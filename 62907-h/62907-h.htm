<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Her name was Stella, and she did not like her name.
Her hair was quite lustrous, but she did not like
her hair, either, and stood combing it jerkily before
a glass which possessed in its midst one of those unfortunate
waves capable of drawing the face of the beholder
into a sad and sometimes startling distortion. Nor did she
take the trouble to keep out of range of the wave, which
proved beyond any reasonable doubt that things were not
going very well with her.</p>

<p>Stella’s face was by no means a discredit to her sex; but
a woman is never seen to the best advantage when at odds with
her hair—one of the few generalities that may fairly be called
safe. Her life was a failure—that worst of all possible
failures:—the kind of failure one just misses grasping. She
phrased it all supremely: “I guess I’m about as deep in the
mire as any one could get without being swallowed up entirely.”</p>

<p>Her eye chanced to light upon a cheaply framed photograph.
With an impulsive, half desperately searching air she took it
in her hand, and her regard assumed a passing gleam of softness.
What she held was the likeness of a young man about
her own age—apparently around twenty—with a somewhat
groping look. Her inspection became hard, critical, unrelenting.
When she put him down it was with a thrust
of annoyance. The young man tottered a moment on the
dizzy edge of a rouge pot and then fell prostrate. She did
not bother to put him on his feet again.</p>

<p>As she reached the dining room, chairs were just being
scraped into business-like adjacency with the table. Stella<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
was really supposed to come down in time to set the
table for breakfast; but now and then, either despite her
high impatience or because of it, she overslept, which was
likely to signify that she had been into the small hours with
a novel. It also meant, in the ruthless way of life’s dispensations,
checks, and balances, that her sister Maud must contrive
to set the table between stirrings and slicings and fryings in
the kitchen. Maud was plain and capable, always pressed
for time, very serious about everything. But she was amiable,
and even owned a sense of humour, of a sort—which
at any rate was better than none at all.</p>

<p>Exclamations of delight were in the air, emanating from
Aunt Alice. “Goody—muffins!” She sniffed approvingly.
“Some more of your grand corn muffins, Maud? Or—no, it
seems to me—Maud, don’t I get a whiff of graham?” And
now her nose was lifted in sheer transport.</p>

<p>“Corn muffins this morning,” Maud replied, a pleased
smile on her somewhat formless lips.</p>

<p>“Goody again, say I!” It was a zest which seemed really
to congratulate all present.</p>

<p>Stella eyed her aunt dully. God had made her, and she
had a good heart: a wide-chested, cheerful, talkative lady of
uncertain years, and a little taller than Maud’s husband, even
when he wore his special high heels. Ted was far from being
a vain man, but he didn’t like to be thought of as a little
man, either, and the cobbler said he’d done that kind of work
before.</p>

<p>Romance? thought Stella, looking unhappily about her.
Where was it? She longed for charm and luxury and brilliant
contacts, but her father was in the harness business.</p>

<p>Well—as he bent low over each sibilant spoonful of orange
juice, wrinkling both eyes a great deal while he delved into
the independable fruit, Frank Meade, stolid and honest and
plain, wouldn’t strike any one as perhaps quite bloated with
romance; and yet, abruptly, a wisp of remorse softened
the daughter’s mood a little as she watched him—almost a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
little errant burst of spiritual vision. But it faded quickly,
and she was brooding: “He might have been worth millions
if he’d switched in time!” Millions, not for themselves but
what they could do to one’s life. It was a distinction, though
perhaps a trifle fine.</p>

<p>Into this sombre reverie broke the quiet voice of her sister:
“Stella, dear, another cup?”</p>

<p>“Such delicious coffee!” endorsed Aunt Alice, who could
always be depended upon to edge in something with the sly
apology of the parenthesis.</p>

<p>Stella suddenly remembered how Irmengarde, in the chapter
where they had afternoon tea somewhere in the Tyrol,
waved aside the entreaties of all her admirers, declining
urged dainties on every hand because the particular romance
of her situation recommended an attitude of delicate ennui.
Stella would have liked borrowing the technique of the Tyrolese
mood, but there you were again. This wasn’t a resort in
the Tyrol but just the familiar San Francisco dining room
with walls of cracked cream. Her name was not Irmengarde.
She was at war with life, but her cup went back to be refilled
notwithstanding.</p>

<p>After breakfast Maud called out to her husband: “Ted,
dear, I wish you’d bring home one of those new patent wringers
with you tonight. The handle’s come off my old one, and
the man at the repair shop said if it ever came off again he
couldn’t fix it.”</p>

<p>“They’re grand!” echoed Aunt Alice over the rail of the
banister. “I think Bert said there were ball bearings inside.”</p>

<p>Ted said all right, his eyes winking behind very bright-looking
glasses, and Maud gave him a capable yet withal
affectionate kiss. Aunt Alice, though afar off now, heard and
shouted unquenchably: “Another one for me, Maud! You’re
all right, Teddy! You’re a good boy! ‘Drink to me only
with thine eyes....’” Her voice strode irrepressibly off
in song.</p>

<p>Stella half consciously heard too; and, out in the kitchen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
her hands in the eternal suds of dish-washing, it set her thrilling
over one of the golden sentences in that chapter where
Irmengarde steals out to view the ruins by moonlight.</p>

<p>“For one who has kissed as I have kissed,” sighed Irmengarde,
“there are no longer any mysteries in the world!”</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>So long as her hands were immersed in the kitchen suds,
Stella could more or less successfully build up about her an
illusion of romance, for it is perhaps the one solid virtue of
dish-washing that it releases the mind to rambles far afield.
However, this task completed and the pan on its peg, life
slumped again badly.</p>

<p>She had not, it is true, always felt this way—until quite
recently, in fact, had not been greatly concerned about the
things that didn’t go with her destiny. But she had encountered
the novel heroine Irmengarde, and then—well, then the
letter from Elsa, brief but wonderful, and really the first
letter since they were small girls living on the same street—before
the Utterbournes began mysteriously to rise. There
had been postcards through the years: now and then from the
eastern school where Elsa had gone so young to escape domestic
unpleasantness; sometimes, later on, a card startlingly
from Europe or the Orient. For her part, Stella had answered
as many as she could with long, impulsive letters, in
which lay revealed the germ which had at length so unhappily
sprung to flower.</p>

<p>Of course Elsa was never very demonstrative, and a postcard
is only a postcard; but that she hadn’t forgotten was the
essential fact. Then, at last, the letter: “I’m going to
open the house in Berkeley for dad. He’s been living at his
club long enough, he says. When I get there I’ll look you
up.”</p>

<p>Stella had waited, and watched the mails eagerly for another
glimpse of Elsa’s thrilling scrawl. Perhaps she would ask
her over to tea. Or perhaps she would take her to a matinée
and they would pour out their hearts to each other afterward.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
However, the time since Elsa must have reached town had at
length run into weeks—and no word.</p>

<p>Stella thought of phoning; had even sketched problematical
telephone conversations; but hadn’t, after all, brought
herself to do it. There was something about Elsa—well,
something that always made approaches a little difficult. This
seemed a part of her almost terrible charm. Yet once they
had come together again, everything would be quite simple
and natural. And so restlessly did she long for a breath of
that richer life, that at last she asked herself: “Why not just
go and see Elsa without waiting to hear—just drop in as
though I happened to be passing by? I’ll do it!” Her day
gave promise of turning out rather better than it had begun.</p>

<p>A desperately conventional maid seated her in the Berkeley
drawing room. Then there was a long, long wait.</p>

<p>Stella, nervously fingering her gloves, adjusting and readjusting
her hat, had plenty of time to note her surroundings:
a room sumptuous yet severe, but above all incommunicative—formal
to a degree which suggested its ostracism
from familiar domestic uses; yes, forbidding. It was like
a blind, a decorous façade, behind which who knew what
might be in progress? And the silence—something almost
ominous—a sense of something beyond or underneath it
all....</p>

<p>She rejoiced in the luxury, but at length grew restive, as
ten, fifteen, twenty minutes—half an hour crept by. She
stirred, coughed. Finally she crossed the room. Just as
she reached the door, however, the spell was broken.</p>

<p>A figure came racing down the stairs. It was Elsa—an
active girl, yet inscrutably calm, heavy dark curly hair
and very droopy eyes at once extremely soft and extremely
bold, and possessed of a kind of unassailable bovine quality.
She stopped abruptly at sight of Stella, stood a moment
facing her with an expression of wholly tactless blankness,
then came forward with hands hospitably extended.</p>

<p>“Stella—you old peach! Hello there!” They kissed
lightly. “Please forgive me. I forgot all about you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>Stella wished she hadn’t come; but her friend went on
with really disarming cordiality: “We can talk for a couple
of minutes while the car’s being brought round. I’m sorry
I have to run off. I’ve been rushed to death getting ready
for my dance—the biggest thing I ever attempted, and a good
deal of a bore, but I’m horribly indebted.” (The Utterbourne
family tree was aristocratic—men now and then in
public life, and streaks of real genius, always more or less
money—and of course the social fruits were proportionate.)
“Sit down.” Her eyes drooped very much indeed at the
corners.</p>

<p>Certainly Elsa couldn’t be called a snob; the fact is, she
was so very much at ease with everybody that no one could
accuse her of not treating all people exactly alike. There
was even something a little humorous in her utter disregard of
anything even approaching the conventions; and what made
it the more surprising just now was her background of the
most immaculate conventionality.</p>

<p>Stella leaned forward, obviously constrained, and wriggled
nervously. “You mustn’t let me keep you.” But Elsa gazed
at her in a perfectly steady yet detached manner, and exclaimed
out of a silence which, it was clear, bore no impress of
awkwardness for her: “You’re looking ripping!”</p>

<p>Stella longed to throw her arms around Elsa and free
her heart of its accumulated turbulence. Instead they merely
sat facing each other on conventional chairs.</p>

<p>Talk of the dance resumed. “A week from tomorrow—I’m
dreadfully excited.” The girl’s eyes drooped pleasantly,
however, and certainly didn’t display any excitement to speak
of. She just gazed on, with disconcerting blankness; and
since it couldn’t have occurred to her that any embarrassment
might accompany this frank chatter about the approaching
festivity, it must have been sheer impulse that brought out
the suggestion: “If you’d care to come, Stella, I’ll see you
get an invitation. Aunt Flora’s engineering everything. If
you like I’ll give her your name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>All very quiet, ordinary, off-hand; yet Stella flushed and
felt her heart plunged into confusion. She was at once
delighted and terrified. “I shouldn’t know a single person
but you—I’m afraid....” Pride, at first, prevented her framing
it any more forcefully; but the next moment she felt so
very wretched about her life that her pride just caved in
and she was faltering, though with a stiff little laugh: “I’m
afraid a ball gown would be a good deal of a problem!” Her
eyelids were burning. She was furious. She felt crushed.</p>

<p>Elsa’s gaze was still upon her, yet it was plain her friend’s
commotion of soul made no overwhelming impression. Her
eyes drooped to signify a forthcoming confidence. “If you’ll
promise not to let it out—we’re planning to announce something
that night—during the supper dance!” Stella thought
miserably of her own lagging and forlorn engagement. But
it didn’t appear that the other girl, with everything so bewilderingly
romantic, was particularly thrilled. All at once,
her expression never changing, she disconcertingly demanded:
“Was that the horn?” and strode to the door. “Let me take
you wherever you’re bound for, Stella—I’ve a little time to
spare. Sorry I can’t stay and talk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks—I think I’ll just be going back to San Francisco.
Please don’t bother, Elsa.”</p>

<p>“Come along. I’ll take you as far as the ferry.”</p>

<p>The doggy little car in which one sat luxuriously low gave
one a sense of distinction, made one forget, even, that in a
few short hours there would be dish water again. Elsa drove
expertly. She could almost have driven a locomotive.
Stella, a little bewildered by the rate at which things had
moved since her slow wait in the silence of the drawing room,
watched her friend with awe and admiration. The only
trouble with the ride to the ferry was its appalling brevity.
And Elsa’s affectionate drawl was in her ears: “Here we are.
I’m going to look you up one of these days. Bye-bye.”
She nodded pleasantly without smiling, and Stella alighted.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way—hold on a minute.” Elsa dove into one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
of the car’s leather pockets and with blithe tactlessness produced
a current <cite>Vogue</cite>. “It will amuse you going across,
and you’ll find some nifty patterns near the back.”</p>

<p>A moment later she had departed, full speed in a bath of
blue smoke—breezed off exactly as she had breezed in, leaving
behind her a vast unhappy vacuum. Stella felt desperately
let down. It was only now she realized how much
she had counted on Elsa.</p>

<p>“I’ll never hear from her again,” she brooded darkly; for
she was rather given to indulging in premonitions. Of course
there would be no invitation to the dance. Elsa would
tremble for what her friend might arrive in! She beat back
the tears angrily with her lashes. This was all that had come
of her hopeful, desperate little expedition.</p>

<p>In the plodding ferry boat Stella thumbed the fashions,
her mood growing ever darker. “What will come next?”
she muttered. The murk of discontent settled thicker and
thicker in her heart, like the fog across the harbour, where
whistles were hooting “Beware!” on every side.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>At about the same hour that Stella reached her decision
to call on Elsa Utterbourne, the employes of the business
houses along lower Market street were streaming out into the
hazy noon in quest of lunch, the stomach being sovereign and
benevolent tyrant there as in all walks of life. A few had
brought lunches from home wrapped in a bit of paper, and
among these was Jerome Stewart, an employe of Oaks, Ferguson
&amp; Whitley, Ships’ Chandlers. He was one of a little
group sprawled on the doorstep of a wholesale candy factory
which made a leader of forty-nine-cent chocolates. He sat
huddled somewhat, his knees raised so high as to provide a
very slanting table indeed for his stock of viands. However,
the clerk was quite unconscious of the fact that his position in
the universe might not be considered a thing of overwhelming
delight.</p>

<p>He never had anything much to say at these times—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
dearth which by no means applied all round. A clerk from
a fishing tackle store was delivering a very graphic lecture
on the difficult art of casting for bass, and exacted the half
guarded attention of the little group.</p>

<p>“The mistake most fishermen make is to whip their rod
when they cast—like that.” You saw exactly. “But,” he
demonstrated, “the right way is like this—v-e-r-y gently.”</p>

<p>Jerome thought he would like to be able to cast well. “I
suppose it’s only a knack,” he mused. But how did one go
about it to learn the knack? The tackle clerk might have
told him, in a general way: application, patience; but Jerome
seldom carried his inchoate ambitions that far.</p>

<p>Another clerk, though his profession was selling typewriters,
had a passion for architecture, and began expatiating
a trifle thickly across his hard boiled egg. And Jerome
followed him with considerable interest, musing in much the
same strain as before. Still, Jerome had never, at best, felt
more than a flirtatious interest in architecture, though he
had talked some of studying it on the side. Well, when
analysed, it proved to be pretty much in a class with many
other idle ambitions: for example, the sea. The sea, oddly
enough, had come very near amounting to a passion with
Jerome Stewart. He had spoken rather grandly once of
taking to the high seas. Even to this day a mild penalty
pursued him; one of the group, suddenly leaning over to
jog his shoulder, urged:</p>

<p>“Come on! You haven’t done your jig for months. Boys,
are we going to let him sit here and hide his talent?”</p>

<p>The crowd laughed goodnaturedly. “Sure! Out you go!
Limber up!” And there was a shuffling movement, as though
the clerk might be about to find himself precipitated on to the
sidewalk, where an admiring ring would form.</p>

<p>Jerome, however, had a very well developed sense of his
own dignity. He resisted, and the interest waned; however,
it was quite true that he had an accomplishment. In the dim
long ago, a seaman at the waterfront had taught him the
hornpipe. Those were the brave, adventurous days. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
after all, he had been content in the end to take up ship
chandlery; and it must ever remain not the least of his
humiliations that once when the chance came to go out for
a day in a fishing tug he had grown fatally reluctant at the
last moment because, to his land-locked eyes, there was a
deal of a sea slopping in. Jerome had come at length to
take it modestly for granted that nearly everything in life
was more or less unattainable.</p>

<p>As he consumed his bread and cheese, with a generous
dessert of home-made cocoanut cake in the offing, the clerk
scanned such snatches of relatively current news as revealed
themselves down the columns of the <cite>Chronicle</cite> from which his
banquet had emerged. This helped him keep posted on
the affairs of the great world. Sometimes there would be
only advertisements, in which case he knew how to accommodate
himself without a struggle. Or it would be the sporting
page, and he always liked that. Jerome seldom saw a game,
but, like most normal individuals, read the sporting news religiously—almost
superstitiously. Today it was mostly small
type about stock and bond matters. Sometimes he wondered
dimly about the stock exchange. But after all it was no
great matter, one way or another.</p>

<p>Some young lady stenographers, arms linked and lips vocal
with fun, strolled past, leaving in their wake a havoc of
masculine eyes. One of the clerks sketchily whistled a
perfectly unsuggestive tune suggestively. The little passing
thrill subsided; and then Jerome began thinking about his
own affair of the heart. It was a curious thing, but the
clerk, although he saw her nearly every day, could never
conjure in his mind a wholly satisfactory picture of the girl
he was going to marry. There was no doubt about his loving
her. He loved her very much indeed. Besides, he was very
anxious to be married; the desire for a hearth of his own
“and kiddies” was firmly fixed in his soul. But it was always
just a little through a haze that he saw the girl herself. He
could never, for one thing, remember definitely whether she
had a dimple; though he knew she was fair, with fresh colour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
and that her hair looked like gold when the sun caught it
right.</p>

<p>Jerome filled his short little pipe and lighted it. The
pipe always gave him a faintly jaunty feeling. If he ever
thought of his destiny as a bit obscure it was certainly never
at such times as this. And at worst, though his destiny
obviously lacked a great many things he more or less desired,
he wouldn’t be willing to change it for anybody else’s.</p>

<p>The world moved busily on every side, heeding him not
a bit. Every one, as a matter of fact, had more important
things to do than notice a chandlery clerk who wasn’t even
sure if his girl had a dimple. What all the world missed,
therefore, was a young man of about twenty or so, thin but
quite well built, a little unkempt, with a somewhat sallow look.
His hair was parted in the middle, and in the back it overlapped
his collar just a trifle—it was that kind of hair. His
clothes had been, in their jeunesse, a bit loud, which would
be a weakness belonging to his years and the fact that he was
engaged; but they had never fitted any too well, and long
continuance of careless carriage had scarcely improved matters
in this direction. Finally, he wore a bright tie which
was fastened near its extremities to his shirt by means of
a patent clip. The clip seemed urging his shoulders forward
and downward. Yes, upon the whole he seemed pretty obscure;
yet it wasn’t that he didn’t want to learn the knack of
life, but only that he thought he couldn’t.</p>

<p>Some whistles blew presently, and a city clock boomed.
The group on the steps of the candy factory broke up, and
Jerome took his way back to the ancient and musty mercantile
house with all sorts of things pertaining to ships displayed
in the windows. He proceeded automatically to a
special peg and hung up his hat, encountering in the vicinity
Mr. Ormand Whitley, the junior partner, indulging in a drink
of water at the old-fashioned cooler. Whitley was only
seventy-five and decidedly spry yet. He eyed the returning
clerk over a crockery cup and very solemnly announced, with
a gesture toward the water:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>“My boy, that killed off every one once except Noah and a
few animals!”</p>

<p>And then he laughed—a laugh which had a bursting start,
like the operation of a steam valve. Yes, there was something
undeniably frivolous about the junior partner, even
though, curiously enough, his head made one think instantly
of the head of some profound Greek philosopher. It might
almost have been the head of Socrates.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Closing time never found Jerome napping. His legs had
been wrapped all the afternoon about the rungs of his stool
with the cheerful yet sluggish permanence one encounters
commonly in the plant kingdom; but now he unwound them,
took down his hat, and went out into a thick winter fog.
His legs really belonged somewhat in the category of beanpoles,
but they carried him over the ground. His gait,
indeed, possessed a slightly headlong quality, without being
quite eager. All his movements seemed a little automatic,
even his head being held at a more or less fixed angle—a
habit indubitably acquired through prolonged association with
the ledger, and encouraging a suspicion that to change its
focus a lever somewhere would have to be touched, or a
spring pressed.</p>

<p>Some blocks along he caught sight, through the fog, of
a familiar back, a little in advance, and the automatic walk
accelerated to an automatic dog-trot.</p>

<p>“Stella!” He was grinning all over with welcome.</p>

<p>She raised her head abruptly and returned his greeting,
with just that degree of impatience which is likely to accompany
a rebound from startled solitude.</p>

<p>“What are you doing ’way down here at such a time of
night?”</p>

<p>She told him, a bit curtly, of her visit to Elsa. Ordinarily
she would have taken a car uptown from the ferry terminus,
but today it had occurred to her that exercise might tend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
a little to relieve her sense of depressing futility. So far as
he was concerned, it had been a most happy decision.</p>

<p>They walked on together, talking of immediate things,
or not talking at all; and he kept sliding his admiring eyes
round for brief surveys of the fair face he could never seem
to keep vividly in his mind. It rather exasperated Stella
to be looked at this way. She might, she thought, almost as
well be an article in any one of the shop windows they were
passing. At length she demanded:</p>

<p>“Is something the matter with my hat?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! I like it very much, Stella.”</p>

<p>She sighed sharply.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“You seem rather mad. Anything up?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and there followed a space of silence,
during which she was conscious, as never hitherto, of her
companion’s imperfections. It couldn’t be denied—the engagement
was dragging. There wasn’t even a ring. They
had decided for the present to call themselves engaged and
save the money a ring would cost. Today, however, she
eyed her vacant finger scornfully, and remembered with a
turbulent pang how Elsa had whispered her own forthcoming
engagement; what a romantic, exciting engagement it
promised to be; such a propitious beginning!</p>

<p>“Well,” she sighed at length, rebelling against so wooden
a silence, “anything new at the store today?”</p>

<p>“No,” Jerome laughed shortly.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t anything ever happen there?”</p>

<p>“No.” He laughed again. And she was thinking: “What
a stupid conversation!” Stella sometimes had sparkling
enough conversations with persons her mind conjured to
flashes of fragmentary tête-à-tête, though they might not, it
is perhaps true, stand up under a test of modern psychology.
“Don’t you ever think of getting into something else?” she
demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve thought of plenty of things I’d like to do, but”—he
drew a fine distinction—“this seems to be about the only
thing I really know <em>how</em> to do.”</p>

<p>“Because you’ve never tried.”</p>

<p>“Well, what would you like to have me try?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there anything you’d like to try yourself?” She
lifted her head impetuously. “If I were a man I think
I’d discover something besides being a clerk in a ship supply
store!”</p>

<p>She was really scolding him now, though she hadn’t meant
to speak with quite such driving scorn. It was a day when
everything grated, nothing went well; a day when blouse
strings knotted and buttons flew off; a day aggravated by everything
and everybody. By this time her mood of revolt was
poignant indeed. Jerome looked at her in mild, inquisitive
amazement.</p>

<p>Stella was groping. She saw herself deep in a mire of
eventlessness and humdrum, and longed to reach out after
the dazzling things in life—romance, excitement, the luxury
of gay, brilliant contacts. In her heart rose a blind little
cry of opaque desire.</p>

<p>Abruptly, right at her elbow, a door slammed. She started
quite violently and turned, in time to behold an arrestingly
handsome man emerging from a railroad and steamship travel
bureau, his hand full of bright-coloured tourist pamphlets.</p>

<p>Her glance was hurried and thrilled. But a tiny miracle
was to happen. A moment later the handsome man came
running up behind her, with quick chivalrous steps.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” he requested, raising his hat in an almost
lavish way; and she saw that he was handing her a pattern
page from her fashion magazine, which she had detached on
the ferry boat and thrust in loosely. It had fallen to the
sidewalk just as she was passing the travel bureau.</p>

<p>“Oh—thank you so much!” she fluttered, flushing with
vague excitement.</p>

<p>The stranger, smiling with an ample bewitchment, restored
her property, lifted his fashionable hat again, and strolled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
into oblivion. Her last searching glance discovered a single
fresh violet in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>“That was a stroke of luck!” Jerome observed in his calm,
automatic manner. “You don’t often get back things you
lose in a crowd.”</p>

<p>Stella, though she beheld in what had just occurred a sly
stroke of irony in that the chivalrous act should have fallen
to another than Jerome, made no immediate reply. Indeed,
for the moment her mind surged richly with excited imaginings.
It was like the beginning of a romance! “I was just
wishing,” she mused, still flushed. “Then a door slammed—as
though fate had been listening all the time, and then....”
Yes, she liked to view life in terms of indefinite grandiloquence.
Still, it had all ended there. The handsome stranger,
who might be a prince setting out on some fabulous tour
of the universe, had quickly disappeared. She would never
see him again.</p>

<p>Once more the fog settled about her. Life slumped.
She felt more dismally hemmed in than ever.</p>

<p>Jerome cheerfully broke the silence with easy commonplaces,
to which she responded moodily if at all. Each time
a space of stillness came between them, Stella was reminded
in a curious, haunting way, of the silence of that long wait in
the Utterbourne drawing room, where there had seemed something
ominous or impending, invisible yet more palpable,
too, than mere fancy.</p>

<p>At length Jerome fell taciturn also; and it was then that the
girl reëstablished the theme which the episode of the fashion
page had broken.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever have a feeling,” she wearily insisted, “you
ought to be getting more out of life?”</p>

<p>This time his laugh was slightly constrained. “I’ve
thought of cutting quite a figure in the world some day.
How do I know but I still may? You never can tell.”</p>

<p>“You certainly won’t unless you make up your mind
to!”</p>

<p>“Oh say!” he protested, his masculine dignity beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
feel menaced. “Why do you want to jump on me all of a
sudden? I guess I’m no worse off, at least, than I was a
year ago.”</p>

<p>But his defensive nonchalance infuriated her. “A year
ago!”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied easily and a trifle coolly, “I lay a whole
lot of plans I don’t always discuss, because I prefer to wait
till I’m ready to spring something definite.”</p>

<p>Their voices were taking on a sharper quality as they
carried their lovers’ quarrel through the home-rush of the
ignoring fog-choked city.</p>

<p>“Anything’s better than submitting! I must say <em>I’d</em> admire
you more if you didn’t just take what’s handed out.”</p>

<p>“You would?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, with a hot fling of her voice, “if you could
only <em>plunge</em>!”</p>

<p>His reply was indeed provoking. “Where to?”</p>

<p>“Almost any place would be better than where we are!”</p>

<p>It was beginning to get under his skin. He smarted,
looking straight before him as he walked. “Oh, I think I
might be a little worse off. Oaks-Ferguson is a good old
house.”</p>

<p>She gestured blindly with the fashion magazine. “It isn’t
so much just money. It’s settling down right here in one
spot for the rest of our lives!” And at length, since he made
no reply, she sighed angrily and stopped. “I’m tired. I
guess I’ll wait at this corner for a car.”</p>

<p>He paused moodily beside her, and she turned on him with
a heavy look in which there seemed no glint now of affection.
“Don’t bother to wait. I know you always walk.”</p>

<p>“You mean you’d rather go the rest of the way without me?”
She stood with pressed lips, staring gloomily down the street.
Finally he continued: “If so, all you’ve got to do is say the
word.”</p>

<p>She was witheringly thinking: “It oughtn’t to be necessary.”
As a matter of fact, she hadn’t really intended bringing about
such a situation; yet even now, as she had it in her heart to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
speak more gently, words of greater harshness rose perversely.</p>

<p>“We don’t seem to be getting anywhere with each other,
Jerome.”</p>

<p>He addressed the ground: “You mean you’re tired of me
for good?”</p>

<p>His very directness irritated her. “I’m certainly tired of the
way we just drag along.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he said at last, speaking with an emotion which,
while genuine enough, also seemed to him rather pleasurably
smacking of the heroic, “if you can do better without me, all
I can say is you better try. Nothing I do seems to suit you.”
And, in his aroused mood of masculine ire, Jerome found it
expedient to add: “It’s my private opinion you don’t exactly
know what you do want.”</p>

<p>The thrust was so palpably true, in a sense, that the girl
abandoned her last scruple of lingering reserve. “I guess it’s
high time we broke off our engagement!”</p>

<p>Her car arrived and she stepped aboard, while Jerome
turned and marched off without a word.</p>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Alone in the street car, Stella brooded it all miserably.
“How unhappy I am,” she thought. And
then she faltered: “I didn’t realize....” Yet she
asked herself, too, what could be left unsaid if the scene were
to be played over—“except, maybe, the actual breaking
off...?” Everything she had said was quite true, yet her
heart was not at rest. “I don’t seem to know which way to
turn any more,” she told herself darkly, almost in tears.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jerome, continuing home on foot, argued that
what had occurred was no great matter. She had succeeded
really in arousing him, and his mood was surprisingly
energetic.</p>

<p>“Well, if she feels <em>that</em> way....” He muttered the opening
phrases of many very vigorous statements designed to
cover his feelings; but for the most part they were destined to
an eternal suspension. “I guess I’m not <em>quite</em> so hopeless....”
Well, the thing had happened, and there was an
end of it. There would be no longer any special reason why
he should vividly picture her in his mind when they were apart;
yet, curiously enough, now their ways were sundered, he
found himself picturing her with singular vividness. “A
fine thing,” he thought, “to keep at a fellow about!” Perhaps
there was more to be got out of life, but had she given any
hint as to how it was to be managed? She <em>had</em> not! He bolstered
his outraged ego the whole of the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>Arrived at his own house, Jerome went at once to his
room. He washed in a desultory manner, then proceeded
to plaster his hair down very slick, even dipping the brush
into the water pitcher to facilitate the process. His evening
toilet completed, the young man sat down in a straight chair,
tipped himself rakishly back against the wall, knocked the
caked ashes out of his jaunty little pipe, filled it with tobacco
from a tumbler supposed to hold his toothbrush, and began
pulling away in a comfortable, dignified fashion. He flattered
himself he didn’t exactly resemble the traditional conception
of a man who has just passed through the ordeal of a
broken engagement, and tried to persuade himself that Stella
would be the heavier loser of the two.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>The next day Mr. Whitley, the junior partner of Oaks, Ferguson
&amp; Whitley’s, was waiting on a couple of old regulars—joking
with them in his undignified yet senile fashion, and
laughing explosively as he wrapped some small purchases.
Jerome presently became aware of the entry of another customer,
and not unwillingly climbed down from the stool of
his destiny.</p>

<p>The customer was peering into one of the dusty show-cases:
a large man, about forty-five, perhaps, dressed in a Palm
Beach suit and wide-brimmed hat. Both hands—and they lay
conspicuously outspread on the showcase before him, almost
as though they were in reality goods whose purchase he was
considering—were amazingly encrusted with precious stones.
On one finger alone were two massive rings set with diamonds
and rubies of almost incredible magnitude, while on another
finger was a curious constellation of tiny stones set into a
golden cube which stood well out from the band itself. The
man was, from head to foot, an exotic—with Italian blood,
probably, though above all a cosmopolitan—and seemed so
full of contradictions that at first one found it simply impossible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
to make him out at all; yet regarding his amazing
picturesqueness there could, at least, be no mistake. He had
about him a gorgeous flavour of romance and mystery.</p>

<p>The customer began with some hesitation: “I wonder—could
you give me any sort of idea what it would take to feed
say about thirty-five people and a small crew during a voyage
to Honolulu?”</p>

<p>Jerome stared. What else could he do? But the customer
smiled and tried to be more coherent.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” he said, in a very friendly, confidential,
optimistic manner, “I’m altogether a novice at this sort of
thing, and just dropped in because I saw up over the door
that you deal in ship supplies. I thought I might as well
stop and enquire, even though I haven’t had time yet to
draw up any lists or such things. <em>Lord</em>, isn’t it a busy life?”</p>

<p>His eyes—large and black and enthusiastic—swam with a
vague yet enkindling glow as he gazed about. “You see,”
he explained, in a voice peculiarly booming and rich, “I’ve
just rented a schooner—taken it for a year—yes, a fine
little fourmaster, with a brand new coat of paint!”</p>

<p>Jerome, of course, noticed that to the man across the counter
ships were sexless objects, and that he spoke of chartering
a vessel exactly as a real estate man might speak of letting
or acquiring a piece of property. Yet, oddly enough,
all this seemed but adding to his charm.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth,” confessed the glittering stranger, removing
his hat and disclosing a black toupee which contrasted
a little queerly with a greying fringe lower down,
“I’ve not more than the remotest idea what you stock up
with.”</p>

<p>“For the galley?” asked Jerome, desiring to be nautical,
yet at the same time wishing to avoid an appearance of
self-consciousness which he always more or less felt when
he spoke of the sea or the things of the sea.</p>

<p>“That’s it!”</p>

<p>“But couldn’t all such be left to the steward, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>“The steward?” For a moment the warm black eyes
appeared a trifle blank. “Well, now I suppose so. Lord,
yes, I suppose the steward would take all such loads off
my mind. But you see,” he leaned across in a perplexed
way, speaking very confidentially indeed, “the fact is I
haven’t got any steward yet.”</p>

<p>“No steward, sir?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, I haven’t yet,” the other apologized. And then
he broadened the confidence, his eyes petitioning and not
a little wistful: “You see the fact is I haven’t got any crew
at all yet.” His face relaxed into a smile of singular sweetness.
“Lord, what a busy life! It seems to me as though
I never more than get started!”</p>

<p>“The trouble is, sir,” said Jerome, “we deal only in ship’s
hardware here.”</p>

<p>“Ah?” returned the customer, obviously a little dismayed;
and he looked about in a helpless way, yet almost hopefully,
too, as though half anticipating, out of the very abundance
of his optimism, that he might discover displayed somewhere
goods which would welcomely disprove the clerk’s assertion.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>“What’s wanted?” asked Mr. Whitley with crisp, rising inflection.
He had come up and was standing beside Jerome,
his hands on his hips, looking more than ever like an intellectual
colossus.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ll explain a little more about it,” replied the
customer, turning from Jerome to the old man. “My name’s
Xenophon Curry—you may have heard of me. Here’s my
card—here’s two of ’em.” And he drew forth a wallet from
the pocket of a vast expanse of black and white checked
woolen vest and took from it two generous bits of pasteboard,
which he handed across with a little bustling gesture. “You
see, I’ve rented a schooner called the <i>Skipping Goone</i>—nice
name, kind of, isn’t it? As I was just explaining to your
young man here, I don’t know just how to go about it to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
a crew and so forth, and I suppose—good Lord, yes!” he
laughed, “first of all there will have to be a captain! Well,
it will come right somehow. I always manage to blunder
through. I guess it must be part of my luck!”</p>

<p>Both Jerome and Mr. Whitley were absorbed in the customer’s
card, and the latter finally observed: “I see you head
an opery troupe!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Xenophon Curry, drawing in deeply and
expanding his ribs exactly the way his singers always did when
they were going to attack a high note. “We’ve just closed
a triumphant tour of the States, and now,” he added, with a
little fling of his head which can only be described as magnificent,
“we’re going to keep right on—west! That’s where
the schooner comes in, do you see? I wouldn’t say—no, I
wouldn’t say but we might go clear round the world!
It’s a wonderful thought, in a way, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The mouths across the counter were dropped in astonishment;
but Mr. Whitley, being so ancient a pupil in the school
of life, possessed rather more ballast to withstand the puff of
unexpected gales than did his clerk. He recovered first, and
made a very smart remark indeed to the effect that he wouldn’t
so much mind going along himself if there were as many
pretty chorus girls as some shows carried. He winked
naughtily. And of course this remark was but the forerunner
of one of his bursting, infectious laughs, which, once released,
ran along quite placidly. Laughter never seemed to discomfit
the junior partner in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>When he had sobered sufficiently, Mr. Whitley began an
inventory of commission houses. “There’s Silvio’s over the
way, and Chiappa’s in Mission street—couldn’t go far
wrong. Your steward, when you find one, will know where
to get the best prices.”</p>

<p>“How about Gambini’s?” asked Jerome.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no end of ’em,” remarked the old man
opulently. For it was, in truth, a neighborhood abounding
in lures for the marketing steward. Chicken feathers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
were forever wafting on the whiff of limes and pineapples,
and when it rained, mouldy oranges sped down on the muddy
breast of gutter streams.</p>

<p>Presently the junior partner felt it incumbent on him to
do a bit more honour to the prodigiousness of what the
customer had disclosed. “An opery troupe!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Xenophon Curry with warm and lingering
affection. “And I want to tell you, gentlemen, I’ve got some
of the finest songbirds in captivity! Next time we play here
I’ll send you down some passes.”</p>

<p>“Be sure they’re well toward the front,” stipulated the old
man. The laugh was crowding in, but he just managed to
add: “My eyes aren’t quite as good as they used to be!”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” observed Jerome respectfully, “you’ve been in
the business all your life?”</p>

<p>“Almost as far back as I can remember,” the impresario
assured him. “Lord, gentlemen, you couldn’t get me to give
it up for a million dollars! It’s the glory of doing what
you’re made to do! I was made for music as sure as God
made little green apples! Music—” he poised it a moment,
quite ecstatically, his eyes raised toward the ceiling, “—that’s
what I’m <em>made</em> for!” But then he seemed to realize that emotion
was rather carrying him away, and that, after all, here he
was in a ship chandlery store, with a clerk and an old man
blinking at him behind the counter; so he ended, very simply,
and with another of his fine smiles: “I’m sorry to have
bothered you about the supplies, but you see I never tried to
run a schooner before. Gentlemen, I’ll wish you good day!”</p>

<p>He made them a gallant flourish and was about to take his
departure, when Jerome suggested: “If you like sir, I could
go through the <i>Skipping Goone</i> to see if there’s anything in
our line you might need. There usually are a lot of odds
and ends missing.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whitley showered looks of affection upon his clerk.
Yes, he was really an ornament to the establishment. But
Xenophon Curry looked positively radiant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“That’s a fine idea, young man! Say, would you? I’ll
show you through myself, from top to bottom, upstairs and
down!”</p>

<p>Jerome came around the counter and accompanied the impresario
to the door. In the street where trucks were thundering
endlessly by along the cobblestones, afternoon was
on the wane, foggy and black. On the threshold the man
extended a hand.</p>

<p>“I’ll come down here in a cab and pick you up, and we’ll
go to the wharf together. It’s ’way over somewhere,” he
waved vaguely.</p>

<p>After they had shaken hands the amazing customer hurried
off. His whole being seemed to exude a fierce yet
always benevolent energy—the most amazing customer who
had ever come into the store. “I’ll be able to tell Stella
something’s happened at Oaks-Ferguson’s today!” he mused;
and then he remembered that she’d no longer be interested
to know whether things happened there or didn’t.</p>

<p>The look of animation faded wanly, and he felt very
much alone. “Maybe I’ll go over anyway and see if she’s
ready to make it up,” he thought, as he stood there in the
doorway beside a swinging shiny oilskin coat and hat, gazing
out into the murk of the dying winter day. But another
voice within him followed close: “Maybe I won’t, too—anyway
not yet awhile.” The first was the voice of the
heart, hungry for the return of a girl’s affection; but the
second was the voice of a still squirming masculine ego.</p>

<p>However, could he have known that at this very moment
Stella was receiving from the postman an invitation,
after all, to Elsa’s dance, and could he have beheld the look
of rapture that came into her face as she realized the good
fortune which had befallen her, Jerome would have experienced
greater difficulty than ever persuading himself that
she was going to be the heavier loser of the two.</p>

<span class="smaller">FATE BEGINS TO PLAY HER CARDS</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">At eleven o’clock the ballroom was crowded. Elsa
Utterbourne, in a handsome, severe, somehow almost
boyish gown, was the centre of interest, and about
her revolved giddily the established dances of the year—a
year when all that was most <i lang="fr">outré</i> was also most popular.</p>

<p>Young interests and enthusiasms and hopes and despairs
and infatuations and intrigues merged and were stirred into
a gay musical shuffle. All the season’s debutantes were there
and a great many of last season’s debutantes; all the important
marriageable young ladies, in fact, and a few of the
important unmarriageable older young ladies, and a great
many young married folks, with their air of unimpeachable
<i lang="fr">savoir-faire</i> and often an inclination to be as scandalous as
possible without quite incurring the frown of the community;
even a sprinkling of blithe young divorcées, since connubial
life can’t be expected to be a grand sweet song in every single
instance, and how can you always tell until you’ve tried it
whether married life with one mate will prove as nice as
married life with another mate—or in extreme cases, a state
of unmarried life with somebody else’s? In a word, the
dance was an entire success.</p>

<p>Captain Utterbourne, looking immensely civilized and
wholly unnautical, sat all in a sort of cynical little slump on
a davenport, his hands lightly thrust into his pockets—a rather
short, stockily built man with somewhat thick neck and wrists,
and a round full face. His eyes were middling small under a
sloping brow, while the nose was inclined to be outstanding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>Having observed Elsa one is equipped in really superlative
degree to graduate to the Captain; for if ever there was
a logic in relationship, it demonstrated itself here! If Elsa’s
eyes were unassailable, the Captain’s whole face was unassailable.
In fact he possessed what is commonly known as a
poker face—inscrutable, always superbly clean shaven; a man
of mystery and enigma; subtly terrifying.</p>

<p>As she sat beside him for a moment now, it became vividly
apparent that the Captain could not possibly be any one else
but the father of Elsa, just as Elsa could not possibly be
any one else but the daughter of the Captain. There was something
restful in the very completeness of heredity’s achievement—only
it must be clearly grasped that whatever was
remarkable in Elsa was doubly and trebly remarkable in him.
There were muffling traits of the long-divorced mother in her—traits
of vague impulsiveness and even an elusive warmth;
but in the Captain one found everything sheer.</p>

<p>Their snatch of talk concerned a singularly handsome man
standing not far from them, leaning negligently yet with
impeccable elegance against a high-backed chair, and gently
swaying a monocle, which never went to his eye.</p>

<p>“At any rate, and even if Flora did arch her brows over his
coming, you can hardly deny that Mr. King is by all odds the
most fascinating person the present occasion has yielded,”
drawled Captain Utterbourne in a tone of subtle affection.</p>

<p>Nor was Elsa prepared to deny this. King had been wafted
into the West under the hushed though wholly laudatory
auspices of her father. It was a good deal of a mystery. There
was something not altogether coherent about his having been
picked up at sea somewhere. But whatever the facts, certain
it was that his eyes, supremely blue and round, captured all on
whom their gaze rested, and that, in short, he was fascinating
beyond question or argument.</p>

<p>“Almost too good to be true,” admitted Elsa humorously
“—like the coloured postcards of Sorrento and Egypt and the
Côte d’Azure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>Her eyes drooped with whimsical appreciation. Suddenly
she jumped up—“I have it!”—and sped off.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Left alone, Captain Utterbourne, humming gently, gazed
across in a quizzical way at the man their talk had just concerned.
He watched him with eyes a little narrowed; and
underneath his lazy quiet there seemed to lurk something
keen and purposeful. It was as though some subtle preparation
were afoot.</p>

<p>Presently he got up, strolled over to where King was lounging
watching the dancers, and nodded with a smile flickering
icily on his lips.</p>

<p>“King,” he began abruptly, yet in the dreamy, drawling
tone which characterized most of his speech, “did you ever sit
down before a map of the world and just let your mind go?
H’m? It’s a gorgeous piece of adventure!” There was a tiny
thrill of fire, and he seemed to be pulling the sentences up
from some profound abyss. “A map of the world—h’m?
What it has cost in toil and ingenuity—the long sifting
of facts—the grim wrestle with legend—h’m?”</p>

<p>What could it mean? What was this new mystery of
approach? There were forces busy here.</p>

<p>“Think,” embroidered the Captain,“—think of the slough
of the Middle Ages, when what bothered the map-makers
most was the pressure of the Church, holding up before them
those obscuring metaphysical allusions to ‘the four corners
of the earth’—when the best they could do was to conceive
of a rectangular world—h’m?—surrounded by—by the unknown!
Just think of it, King!”</p>

<p>A waltz swayed the dancers all about them. Yes, there
were forces busy here.</p>

<p>Elsa dashed up. “Oh, here you are!” She laughed easily
and not very mirthfully. “Yes, I know—I’m coming,”
she soothingly interpolated over her shoulder to a youth with
mussed hair who had wildly pursued her waving a program<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
with its flying cord and pencil. “I wanted Mr. King
to meet Miss Meade.” She grasped his arm and informally
hurried him off, with a slight nod toward her father, which
somehow fulfilled every demand of etiquette.</p>

<p>Not far away sat Stella, looking quite as delightful for
the occasion as she felt over her thrilling share in it. She
was wearing a dress Elsa had insisted upon lending her—“since
you seem to be so tired of your own clothes”; it was
her way of being tactful. There had been some demur, but
Elsa, as usual, had her own way—said, indeed, she would positively
have the invitation withdrawn unless Stella agreed to
take the dress too. There was a good deal of whimsy about
Elsa.</p>

<p>Mr. King saluted Stella with one of his most fascinating
smiles. He bowed, too, in a courtly way, which made her
catch her breath a little. “I’m delighted,” he murmured.</p>

<p>And Stella, her eyes strangely full of light, paused just
short of exclaiming: “There’s something about you—something
I seem to remember....”</p>

<p>Elsa prepared to dance off with her impatient partner, but
turned to her father, who had strolled up, and warned him
with dry playfulness: “Please keep an eye on them, and
don’t let them get so interested in each other that they forget
about supper, because Stella has that dance taken—haven’t
you, Stella?” She had been unflagging and a little
brazen in her friend’s behalf.</p>

<p>“I believe so,” fluttered Stella, excitedly glancing at her
card, though in truth, her face all alight with momentarily
realized dreams, she wasn’t much concerned over the possibility
of any mere individual’s being able to subtract her attention
from the glittering whole. Nevertheless, that is exactly
what did happen. She fell right into the trap Elsa had mockingly
cautioned against; and this is how it all came about.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Captain Utterbourne, with faint petulance, his lips twitching
to a smile of finely etched satire, scrupulously withdrew; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
he turned back a moment and faced King with the most affectionate
and least complex expression of which he was capable.</p>

<p>“By the way, would you mind dropping in at my office tomorrow?
You know where we are—Hyde’s. There’s something
I’d like to go into—h’m?” His mere look subtly completed
the sentence; for Captain Utterbourne had perfected
the art of intelligible suspension. Mr. King agreed eagerly,
though he kept his monocle spinning in a thoroughly sophisticated
and idle fashion. Utterbourne had been but glancingly
arrested in his departure—all this was very high art.
With a faint bow to Stella, which delicately rebuked her for
having been the means of interrupting him at a moment when
he had cryptically begun to open his mind to his new favourite,
the Captain was gone; and they saw him pause, in passing,
to banter his sister Flora, just glancingly, as she sat in
a little whirl of gentle gossip near the punch bowl.</p>

<p>“May I sit down here?” suggested Mr. King gracefully;
and found her looking up at him almost coyly, as though
having tête-à-têtes with men of his calibre were indeed an established
phase of her life. But naturally her heart was fluttering
very much.</p>

<p>He talked easily and in a conventionally flirtatious manner:
had been noticing her all evening, he said—though as
a matter of fact, he was but recently arrived. And she, almost
painfully excited, played back in quite the same spirit,
though it privately cost a greater effort. Mr. King was so
bewilderingly nice that she used every instinctive gift in
an effort to please and impress him: yes, just giddily let herself
go.</p>

<p>They talked of pleasant immediacies. When she dropped
her handkerchief, he stooped to pick it up; and when he
handed it to her something—something vaguely reminiscent—made
her feel as she had felt when the introduction was
taking place. Certainly no one had ever before treated her
with such a wealth of worldly chivalry.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” she fluttered; and he returned a deft little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
gesture. Then another flash of reminiscence brought a gay
cry to her lips. “Oh, now I know! We’ve met before—though
I’m <em>sure</em> you’ll never remember!” And as she spoke
of the episode of the rescued fashion page, Stella saw again
a handsome stranger emerging from the travel bureau, his
hand full of alluring pamphlets, and in his buttonhole a single
violet. Surely she hadn’t been mistaken?</p>

<p>Just at first he didn’t seem to remember, but in an instant
he chivalrously remembered it all with the utmost vividness.
They discussed the curious little coincidence. It was quite
wonderful. Her romantic nature made the lavish most of a
circumstance which to another might seem casual in the extreme.
Such things really happen pretty often, but her mood
insisted upon the most rosy values; and indeed, the tiny episode,
from the moment he did remember, seemed to carry
them swiftly along toward an intimacy undreamed of a moment
since.</p>

<p>He looked at her, she felt, almost consumingly with his
magnetic round blue eyes.</p>

<p>Presently he asked whether she wouldn’t like some punch,
and she said she would, so they got up and he gave her his
worldly arm. She had never before been so satisfyingly
thrilled.</p>

<p>Mr. King handed her a glass of punch, making a minute
ceremony of it; and she fluttered again, and smiled across at
him quite archly over the rim as she sipped.</p>

<p>He asked her: “I suppose you spend about all your time
dancing, Miss Meade? It seems to be the rage nowadays.”</p>

<p>And while she ought, of course, to have laughed it off,
or been at least flirtingly evasive, she looked at him instead
with an impulse of wistfulness out of her meagre life, and a
wave of unassuming candour brought out the admission: “I
really don’t very much, but I enjoy it immensely. Don’t you
think this is a very nice party?”</p>

<p>He seemed to regard her with subtly keener interest; and,
curiously enough, it was just that impulsive little flash of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
candour in Stella, to begin with, that stimulated in Mr. King
a sentiment destined at last to involve her most surprisingly.
She had a very definite picture, however, of the sort of impression
she wanted to make on this man—the impression he
seemed irresistibly to invite—and it would have bewildered
her to think he might be getting another picture altogether.</p>

<p>He asked her if she wouldn’t like to dance, and without
even glancing at her card she said yes she would; and then
half wished she had said no, because she was hazy about the
new steps, and was desperately afraid Mr. King would find
her, after all, disappointing.</p>

<p>But they danced, and everything went splendidly, and he
didn’t find her so disappointing, although himself so immaculately
proficient in the new steps.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>After that Stella thought of course he would leave her and
find some one else on whom to spend his superlative charms.
It seemed incredible he shouldn’t. But instead he gave her
his ceremonious arm again and escorted her to a romantic,
shadowy nook, and sat down beside her. And it was then,
for the first time, that Stella dared think he might be growing
really interested in her.</p>

<p>“He must be impressed!” she thought, thrilling more than
ever. “Perhaps....” But she dared not, even in secret,
tempt herself with all the delirious possibilities that crowded
her brain just then.</p>

<p>King leaned a little toward her as she sat excitedly opening
and shutting Elsa’s fan in her lap.</p>

<p>“You must feel warm, even though you don’t show it,” he
said, smiling gallantly. “Let me fan you.” And when she
had surrendered the fan, with a delighted, coquettish gesture,
Mr. King began waving it slowly back and forth as he
talked—not really stirring up a great deal of breeze, but
beautifully establishing an atmosphere of coolness and languor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>“You can imagine you’re an Egyptian princess, and I’m
one of those nice glossy black slaves, with a fan of papyrus
or ostrich plumes—what is it they use?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” replied Stella in a very worldly tone, “I’m
afraid I don’t know, really!” She laughed a brief, happy
laugh, and, after a little more appropriate repartee, she insisted:
“I’m sure your arm must be getting tired. Suppose
the Egyptian princess tells her slave he may stop fanning her
until ...”</p>

<p>“Until after she’s danced again?”</p>

<p>Too late Stella realized she had gauchely precipitated a
second invitation. But he seemed genuinely to welcome it
(“That’s a divine waltz,” he observed irreproachably) and
anyhow she couldn’t resist appearing on the floor again with
him. As they danced she could hardly help noticing how
people watched them. It was a delicious sensation. Fortunate
for her he had come late—too late to fill his card.
Normally, she guessed, it wouldn’t require much exertion on
his part!</p>

<p>And still he didn’t leave her. Jesting merrily they went
about in search of another shadowy nook, and when they had
found one to their liking, sat down and resumed their talk.
Of course in talk they didn’t go beneath those superficial currents
which sociologists tell us are essential to mutual soundings-out
within the herd. One talks of the weather or the
high cost of everything, or if one is especially gifted, perhaps,
one talks about Egyptian princesses—and all the while
keeps his ears alert for that “low growl” which shall warn
him he is in the wrong pew. But behold! there was no low
growl. She heard none, he heard none. And yet it would
seem as though these two: this girl in revolt against life and
this the most fascinating man at the ball, must belong in very
widely severed pews indeed.</p>

<p>“Where is your home, Mr. King?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Ah, how shall I answer?” he cried in mock consternation.
“I’m afraid I’ve become a kind of permanent tramp—travelling
a lot and—well, jogging about generally.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“Abroad?” she asked, clasping her hands but making otherwise
a valiant effort not to be overcome with awe.</p>

<p>“Pretty much all over the globe,” he admitted. “I’ve
whistled up the sun sitting astride the pyramids; I’ve
strummed a ukulele on the beach at Waikiki; I’ve dabbled a
bit at Monte Carlo; I’ve sipped tea with little doll-like geisha
girls in Yokohama. What haven’t I done, and where haven’t
I been?” He looked honestly almost appalled at his own
wealth of experience; and she hung on his words, her face
responsive to the thrill in her heart.</p>

<p>A little later on they were speaking of the earthquake and
how the city had developed out of calamity. And then, since
she had quoted, in this connection, something her father had
said, and since they were on the subject of business generally
Mr. King suggested: “May I ask what your father’s business
is?”</p>

<p>And Stella—unhappy Stella. She ran her fingers nervously
along the feathers of the fan in her lap, and was silent
for just a moment, the old rebellion, impotent but hot, bringing
its flush to her face. Then slowly she raised her eyes to
his, unexpectedly found in them the inspiration she had
missed elsewhere, and replied quite frankly, with the same sort
of candour that had slipped in more than once already:
“My father’s business is harness.”</p>

<p>Did he hear a growl? Was he in the wrong pew? Destiny
seemed to hold her breath. But if there was any growl now
it was so faint as to recommend no drastic alarums and excursions.
“Harness—ah.” That was all. And he went on
in the same gracefully adjusted tone: “Perhaps not quite so
much demand, but still an important item.” And he added,
breaking into the more general field the topic seemed prompting:
“I like a good horse. I suppose you ride, Miss Meade?”</p>

<p>“Oh—occasionally,” she replied, her face still slightly
flushed with suppressed rebellion, but smiling with that attempt
at archness she told herself the situation required.
“Occasionally”—yet what she really meant was a long time
ago; for it was highly possible the staid old family horse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
used only for driving now, might expire of amazement were
Stella to take a notion to mount.</p>

<p>“It would give me ever so much pleasure if I might call.
May I?” He looked very worldly and pleading over the conventional
request.</p>

<p>And then—ah, but one knows in advance what she must say,
and one sees most clearly, at length, how it was that she
forgot the supper dance entirely.</p>

<p>Here seemed the dawn of a wonderful dream indeed—as
though gates were suddenly opening in her life. She responded
to Ferdinand King in waves of delirium. Just once
she thought of Jerome; and his defects, under the warm spell
of beauty which surrounded her now, turned him into almost
a caricature. Jerome and Mr. King! She forgot herself
and laughed aloud; then, flushing, made her head toss flirtingly
and pretended she had been thinking of something else
entirely.</p>

<p>Well, in truth, the contrast would be nothing short of
striking; for at this stage of his career Ferdinand King was
in the finest prime of his incontestible fascination. He was
about forty, with rich plumy hair, white at either temple.
His face, so arrestingly handsome, was just a little too ruddy,
perhaps, to allow any one’s crediting his destiny with never
having wooed the heartening cup. His mouth was almost a
perfect “cupid’s bow.” A very grand, big, daring, gallant,
adventurous sort of man, who appeared altogether superb in
evening clothes, and would make a magnificent perpetual best
man at fashionable weddings. One at once associated him
with gardenias and teacups; yet there was always that indefinable
grandness and air of <em>difference</em> about him which made the
man seem far indeed from any mere usual type of social flâneur.
A gay old dog, though a mature and worldly and white-templed
dog, too—which from the beginning of the world, has
been the most fascinating type to be encountered.</p>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Captain Utterbourne was involved with a vague
but immensely lucrative corporation calling itself the
Hyde Packet Company. The business was tramp
freighters—vessels of one or two thousand tons, mostly, with
business-like mien, which poked nondescript noses into every
corner of the navigable world where commerce was to be
scented. The <i>Star of Troy</i> was Captain Utterbourne’s own
cherished and particular tramp: a sturdy craft with bulging,
broad-beamed bow and very decent living quarters—for the
Captain was somewhat particular how he lived. How he happened
to be a sea captain was a supreme enigma. It baffled
everybody. There hadn’t been a grain of salt in the family
until now. But that he was a sea captain had to be accepted as
a fact. To tell the truth, that was all you could hope to do with
Utterbourne—simply accept him. There was no alternative.</p>

<p>The Hyde offices (despite the prosperity of the stockholders)
were just one large dusty room, the walls smoky and cluttered
with maps; but it was always a lively place. A good many
desks were crowded into it, at one of which, in a modest corner,
sat Captain Utterbourne. Men mostly in shirt sleeves kept
up a busy drone, abetted by intelligent-looking girls deep in
dictation and the clatter of typing. The Captain, however,
sat unheeding in the midst of everything.</p>

<p>When Ferdinand King arrived he found Utterbourne
absorbed in a sheet of paper before him, upon which he was
engaged with a pencil. The caller hesitated a moment, half
glancing about for an office boy; but almost at once his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
presence was perceived, and, flinging down his pencil with a
tiny gesture, the Captain rose and held out a hand.</p>

<p>“Come in, please,” he said in a quaint sing-song, his lips
parting with a smile which might be called almost insolent
were one not at the same time conflictingly sure that the
emotion behind it was wholly amiable. “Have a chair.
We’re not very sumptuous, since our business doesn’t call for
much style.”</p>

<p>When one came into the presence of Captain Utterbourne
one seemed coming into the presence of a man about whom
strange currents eddied. He wasn’t wholly reassuring—in
fact, no one standing before him could feel quite easy or as
though his soul was his own. Still, this aura about him had
a haunting and insidious attraction, too, so that even though
it might prove fatal, one would not care altogether to escape.</p>

<p>King was a little startled to observe that the sheet of paper
on which the other had been so diligently at work was covered
merely with a lot of scrawled anchors, which the Captain had
depicted in a variety of positions: now upright, as though
in the act of being lowered, with the stock horizontal and the
shank standing perpendicular; again in a position of repose,
with the stock and one fluke resting, one assumed, on the bed
to the sea. Whenever Utterbourne grew absorbed in anchors
it was plain to those who knew him as well as it is ever
possible to know a man with a poker face, that he was concentrating
on some new enterprise.</p>

<p>The Captain, half sheepishly noticing that his handiwork
had been detected, muttered: “No doubt every one has his
own unconscious emblem—a stray out of the past, perhaps—h’m?”
His lips moved with apparent reluctance, as though
it annoyed him to think that nobody, even after all these
centuries of progress, had been able to render speech possible
without visible effort. He tilted back in his chair somewhat
rigidly, his toes just touching the floor as he rocked, and
hummed Macdowell’s <cite>To a Wild Rose</cite> a moment in a mood of
vaguely pleasureable detachment. At length, however, there
was a reviving “<em>Well, now</em>,” and King leaned a little toward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
him, prepared to hear unfolded the mysterious substance which
had seemed hovering in the air last evening. What was
going forward behind that card-player’s mask?</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>The Captain’s little eyes looked quite mild and affectionate,
but they also held their tiny glint of fire. He gazed at
Ferdinand King in an unwavering, disconcerting way, tapping
with his pencil upon the wooden shelf he had pulled out of
the desk to form an improvised table between them, and uttering
an occasional dreamy “H’m?” But in a moment or so
the pencil was laid aside, and he began speaking, his chin
nestled cosily in his hands.</p>

<p>“King,” he said, “did you ever hear of Hagen’s Island?”</p>

<p>The other man shook his head, but seemed at the same time
to recognize the curious little prelude about maps as hinging
here. He waited almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Hagen’s Island,” resumed the Captain, “had governments
quarreling over it in its time. I don’t doubt but it might
once have been quite capable of bringing on a war somewhere.
Oh, heaven! the laughter behind it all—behind all life, for
that matter, King! H’m?—h’m? I spent a whole dreamy
spring afternoon once, with crocuses just blooming outside,
going through speeches about far off Hagen’s Island delivered
in Parliament. That was in connection with the coaling
station project which got under way and then was abandoned,
with engineers right on the spot. Maybe it was all politics—I
don’t know.” He shrugged.</p>

<p>“The island proved to be too remote. In short, it was a
failure. Some newspaper wag dubbed it ‘the football of the
Indian Ocean,’ and then the last ripple died out.” He seemed
to lose himself a moment, as in a fog at sea; and King, mystified
but much interested, waited for him to go on. The narrative
was characteristically resumed from a rather startlingly
new angle.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time there was a Dutchman—long before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the coaling station. His name was Vander Hagen, and his
mania was to start an ideal commonwealth. Every generation
somebody or other tries it. Isn’t it funny? Vander Hagen
had passionate ideas about representation and individual rights.
There seems to have been a lot about the Greeks in his plan.
Well,” the Captain shrugged, “he died of a broken dream,
and was buried on the island where the commonwealth had
been tried and found wanting. The remnant of his disciples
went back home in a mist of disillusion. A few years later if
his name chanced to be mentioned anywhere, people would
exclaim: ‘Who was Vander Hagen?’ Isn’t it disillusionizing,
King? Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Utterbourne smiled one of his most enigmatic smiles, and
after another of the half quizzical pauses continued: “I found
a copy of the Dutchman’s <cite>Journal</cite> a few years ago in one of
those little book stalls along the Seine in Paris. It was an
English translation, and on the fly leaf was written: ‘From
Daisy to Paul, with compliments of the season.’ He smiled in
a flickering way—it was just a little like the play of light and
shade beneath a tree in summer.</p>

<p>“Months later, with a cargo of wheat for Madagascar, I
began reading the <cite>Journal</cite>, and a strange—King, an almost
uncanny—desire to pay the island a visit came upon me.
My people on the <i>Star of Troy</i> thought I was mad. That was
a good while ago—they know me better now—h’m? Well, I
couldn’t seem to shake that sombre and majestic Dutchman off
my back, King. He’d settled, and I knew there was only one
way to be rid of him. Besides—h’m?—I’d thought of a little
scheme of my own.</p>

<p>“There were reefs—a wicked necklace with a conscience of
lead. We found some ruined docks and a spectral derrick—all
that remains of the coaling station fiasco—and silence,
King. Silence.... Not a soul on the island, of course.
Every venture ever started there has fallen through.” And
after a moment he murmured: “By the way, King, are you
superstitious?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“No,” the other laughed shortly, beginning just in a hazy
manner to piece things together in his mind and feel along
toward conclusions.</p>

<p>“Good,” mused Captain Utterbourne, his voice barely
audible. “Good. I think we’re making progress, King.”
And he gazed at him tenderly, yet with eyes half shut, as when
he sat watching and watching while the dancers whirled about
them.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SKIPPING GOONE GETS A MASTER</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Xenophon Curry, impresario extraordinary, sat sipping
his breakfast coffee and perusing the morning
paper. He looked extremely optimistic.</p>

<p>The day before he had shown an obliging chandlery clerk
over the <i>Skipping Goone</i>, “upstairs and down,” and the clerk
had an eagle eye for such missing items as deck hose and
cabin door knobs; and though the clerk was but a humble
clerk, and although his contribution to the progress of events
was frankly minor, the impresario nevertheless felt himself
appreciably nearer the realization of his daring project. He
and the clerk had partaken of ice cream soda together afterward
in a queer little confection emporium near the waterfront.
And, all in all, it had seemed a highly important day.</p>

<p>Another cause for optimism was the fact that rehearsals
were going surprisingly well. He would make people sit up
after the tour had got under way! Indeed, his songbirds
were artists to be proud of—not so much, perhaps, because
of special genius as for their almost uncanny sticking proclivities.
It was, in truth, an organization of the most amazing
sort, which had built itself up gradually about Xenophon
Curry’s vast heart. Surely no organization was ever before
so supremely an affair of the heart. Curry had drawn
his songbirds to him from all over the world. Essentially
a cosmopolitan himself (“I’m a dyed-in-the-wool hybrid”)
he had kept open house in his heart for all sorts and
conditions of people. Under his wing, one by one, he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
gathered the struggling, the discouraged, the heavy-laden—even
a soul now and then that called itself plainly down and
out. And not only songbirds, but a tiny orchestra had
been drawn in, too, by patient degrees: now a violinist with
aspiring soul rescued from some dreadful little café chantant
in Vienna; now a flute player off the hills of Sicily; again
a lowly snare drummer in a band somewhere in Kentucky,
who had a deep-seated passion for the kettles. They knew
they could count on him to the last ditch, and so were willing
to follow anywhere he led. It was really a little touching.
Certainly in no other way would it have been possible
for Mr. Curry to do the things he had done, for, from
a worldly point of view, no impresario, barring none, ever
met with such shocking and consistent adversity.</p>

<p>Over his eggs the impresario read of an auction sale to
be held that afternoon at Crawl Hill and the list sounded
promising. Mr. Curry made it a point to attend auctions
whenever possible, for in this manner he was sometimes able
to pick up odd bits to use as properties in his necessarily
heterogeneous productions. He decided to stroll around and
nose for bargains that might fit into the world tour.</p>

<p>The weather being delightful, Curry literally did stroll.
But when he had at length covered some considerable distance
he began to ask himself where Crawl Hill was, after
all. He remembered it vaguely, and was certain of the
general neighbourhood; but just how to get there was developing
into another matter. He would have to begin inquiring.
He half paused. And as he did so a pleasant
voice challenged him at his elbow.</p>

<p>The impresario turned and faced a tall, quite handsome
lady, near his own age, gowned expensively and somewhat
complexly. Her eyes were frank, her demeanour that of
one who has been much about and feels at home in the
combinations of a moving life without sacrificing a rather
unusual fund of freshness.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” she said, smiling easily and just a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
little grandly, “but I wonder if you could tell me how to
get to Crawl Hill?”</p>

<p>Mr. Curry’s face lighted humorously. “A moment more
and I might have put the same question to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I <em>see</em>!” she observed, simply and even graciously,
much as though they were old friends. “Quite a <em>coincidence</em>—isn’t
it? I thought I knew <em>perfectly</em> well when I started
<em>out</em>, but this part of the city has changed so!”</p>

<p>“Lord, hasn’t it! Crawl Hill used to be one of those big
places”—he enlarged a little upon the circumstances, adding:
“Since we’re both headed for the same auction, we might
walk on together, and I’ll ask the way.”</p>

<p>“It’s very kind of you, I’m <em>sure</em>!” she told him, her manner
more than ever gracious.</p>

<p>So the stroll was thus resumed, and Mr. Curry was struck
with the peculiar ease he felt from the very beginning in
his new companion’s company. Their talk, as they proceeded,
widened gradually to embrace a considerable range of subjects:
cheerful commonplaces—just, as a contemporary
puts it, “the talk which goes up the chimney with the spark
of the wood fire.” Discreet, polite side-glances revealed,
for him, an undoubtedly romantic lady nearly as tall as
himself, vaguely lavish, just faintly overpowering in her enthusiasms,
who walked along with free, hopeful stride
and lifted her arching brows in an unbroken expression of
communicative pleasantness. She wore a cloak made from
an Arabian gondura—a fabric of rusty plum with intricate
embellishment of bright green braid. There were wide flowing
sleeves; and underneath the cloak one now and then caught
sight of confusing details; a bit of Paisley, blue serge,
large decorated brass buttons. Her hat was an oddly shaped
straw with an ample feather falling off behind.</p>

<p>The lady, for her part, quickly noted his air of bustling
optimism and seemed responding to it with unconscious
warmth; at first, it is true, she had eyed his rings and general
air of the exotic with some slight twinges of doubt: but after
she had received one or two of his radiant smiles it was only too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
plain she felt it would be unhandsome to hold so small a
matter against him. Indeed, he seemed to perceive in her at
once an element of happy tolerance, at the same time that he
was very sure he caught a genuine passion for the artistic.
Above all he couldn’t but be impressed with the uplifting and
flowing quality in her rich voice. “I learned about the auction
from some <em>friends</em> who have been spending months in Morocco,
where they <em>heard</em> about Mr. Hoadley’s death and immediately
thought about the lovely ‘things’ every one remembers
having seen in his house here in San Fran<em>cisco</em>!” Her
sentences, inclined to be “Germanic,” moved with the liquid
fluency of a wide, well-mannered river. And there were words
she stressed saliently or perhaps rather lingered over; it was
a little quaint. One came to listen for them. Other words,
too, which, by the most marvellous yet wholly artless subtlety
in shading, she managed to slip within quotation marks—although,
as a matter of fact, there was seldom any real reason
for their being quoted. “I don’t expect to find a <em>thing</em> that
I’ll really <em>buy</em>, for everything’s sure to be quite <em>dear</em>, you
know, considering how immensely rich Mr. Hoadley was when
he did his <em>collecting</em>, although it’s always pleasant to just
visit these ‘sales’ and look around and perhaps pick up some
little trifles that catch one’s <em>fancy</em>—as trifles have such an irresistible
way of <em>doing</em>!”</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Crawl Hill, when at last they reached it, proved to be a tall
frowning old house, whose once considerable grounds had
shrunk to a mere wisp of withered lawn. Within they breathed
a heavy mustiness. It was a bit ghostly, too—decidedly a
place to be visited by daylight.</p>

<p>And as for the little adventure—well, it didn’t, after all,
lapse at the door. Mr. Curry, as they moved on together
through the crowd, told himself there was nothing so very unusual
in their having met like this. He was always meeting
people—was a Bohemian—freely admitted it. But was this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
lady a Bohemian also? And who was she? He was on the
verge of learning, and the method was rather happy.</p>

<p>It chanced that somewhat apart from the throng stood a
satin-wood console of the French Renaissance period, on
which reposed an ornate silver card tray. She liked the tray—“not
that one would really <em>want</em> it, you know, for of
course it is a little ‘overdone’; but it reminds one of the
<em>Victorians</em>—doesn’t it?—and I think there was much to
<em>admire</em> in them, although it has become the fashion to sneer
at their dust-catching ‘ideas.’”</p>

<p>And the tray gave Mr. Curry an unexpected cue. He
smiled and drew out his wallet, then, selecting one of his
cards, tossed it humorously down. Her eyes lighted quickly,
and, without a word, she brought out one of her own,
too, and placed it beside his on the tray. Then they stood
there side by side, like two absurd children, reading each
other’s cards. Hers was very modest and simple: Flora
Utterbourne, with no address. But his, being so ambitious,
not to say overwhelming an affair, naturally called for a
small smiling effusion on her part.</p>

<p>“I know you by ‘reputation,’ though I’ve never had the
pleasure of attending one of your <em>performances</em>. It’s
always sounded so <em>interesting</em>!”</p>

<p>And then—well, then he just plunged in and began telling
her all about the world tour; and she suggested they sit down
“in those delightful Lorenzo di Medici <em>chairs</em>;” no one
would object, she was sure; and if they wanted to sell the
chairs before he had finished telling her about the world
tour, why then they would just move over to “that ‘Huguenot’
bench in the hall, which is <em>sure</em> not to be ‘put up,’” she
laughed, “until quite the last <em>thing</em>!” So they sat in the
Lorenzo di Medici chairs while the auction hummed on
about them, and he opened his ardent heart, and she followed
everything he said with an immense facial responsiveness.
(Sometimes people found this a trifle disconcerting, because
her feeling about whatever you were saying had a way of seeming
just a bit stronger than your own.) And, in her large,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
rich, impulsive way she would keep interrupting him with
fragments of delighted appreciation. “By <em>Schooner</em>!” for instance:
“but this is the most amazing thing I ever <em>heard</em> of!”
Or again: “No crew, but a fresh coat of paint!” She could
grasp the essential high points of humour in a situation and
bring them together; yet there was nothing the least satirical
or mocking. The impresario felt on friendly turf, and deluged
her with eager, bustling words. He became inspired,
impassioned. He gestured a little wildly. But she found it
all wildness with an appealing tang, and rejoiced in the current
of his really electric enthusiasm. When he had finished, his
whole eloquent person relaxed slowly. Mr. Curry was like a
superb engine, which couldn’t be expected to cool off just in a
minute.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>A gate-legged mahogany table had arrested Miss Utterbourne’s
notice. She calculated its fineness with an eye accurate
from long and loving experience. She became enthusiastic,
and finally, smiling excitedly at the impresario, whispered:
“I’m going to <em>bid</em> on it!”</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Curry at once took a step and cleared his
throat, gallantly ready to do the actual bidding for her; but
he was surprised to find himself wonderfully eclipsed by the
lady herself, who pressed resolutely up through the crowd
toward the auctioneer, her manner all at once proclaiming
her an adept at this sort of thing.</p>

<p>“Fifty!” she tendered firmly.</p>

<p>“Fifty-five,” countered a man with cold eyes and shiny
elbows.</p>

<p>“Sixty!”</p>

<p>She was serene and undaunted, and the opponent withdrew
at seventy-five.</p>

<p>“I <em>got</em> it!” she exulted, giving her head a small toss.
“And of course an absurd ‘bargain,’ considering its unusual
<em>size</em>, though a less expensive one would have served my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
<em>purpose</em>, if it weren’t that ‘gate-legged’ tables are my special
<em>weakness</em>!”</p>

<p>He couldn’t conceal his astonishment. “You went after it
as though you made a real business of such things.” And
she had another of his fine smiles.</p>

<p>“Well, you see I <em>do</em>—in a <em>way</em>!”</p>

<p>“What! A business of bidding at auctions?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she laughed, “my ‘business’ is <em>apartments</em>!”</p>

<p>“Apartments!”</p>

<p>She had put on her gold-rimmed nippers, and they straddled
her nose in a humorous, faintly pompous manner. “It’s the
only way I can gratify my <em>craving</em> for rare and ‘intriguing’
<em>possessions</em>! You see I take an apartment, furnish it with all
the lovely ‘things’ I couldn’t afford for <em>myself</em>, and then turn
the key over to a tenant who will pay me the <em>difference</em>!” Her
face displayed tokens of the anxiety which belonged to an at
length pretty involved background of sub-leased domiciles.
“Of <em>course</em>,” she confessed, speaking now slowly, almost cosily,
“it’s always a pang to move out, though there’s the new
apartment to begin ‘planning,’ and then,” her voice dropping
a little and her eyes smiling in a deliciously sly way behind
their friendly nippers, “I sometimes just <em>have</em> to slip a few
things <em>along</em> with me—my tendency is to ‘over-furnish’
anyhow.”</p>

<p>He by no means missed the note of pathos in her brave little
scheme; yet she had assured him, too: “You’d be <em>surprised</em>
how settled I manage to <em>feel</em> in the midst of what, of
course, in one sense, doesn’t really <em>belong</em> to me!”</p>

<p>“That’s the only home you have, then—the home that only
lasts until it’s furnished?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she slowly admitted, “I’m <em>afraid</em> so. Sometimes
there <em>does</em> seem a good deal of ‘irony’ deep down <em>underneath</em>
everything!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” sighed the impresario, though a radiant smile broke
through in spite of him, “no one understands such things
better than I. Life’s just full of irony, isn’t it?—whichever
way you turn!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“My brother, Captain Utterbourne,” she observed, “has all
<em>sorts</em> of subtle theories about it, though I never can remember
just how they go <em>afterward</em>, since, you see, he has a way of
‘conveying’ so much and yet really saying so <em>little</em>!”</p>

<p>There was a breath of musing silence between them, and
then Mr. Curry’s eyes lighted suddenly. “You mean—a sea
captain?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she told him, “although I often feel it’s more a
<em>hobby</em> with him than exactly a <em>profession</em>.” Her smile was
full of humour and a kind of furtive family loyalty.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” ventured the impresario impulsively, “if your
brother would be willing to help me—that is, give me a little
advice....”</p>

<p>“Oh, I <em>see</em>!” she cried, quickly catching the drift behind his
eagerness. “About the ‘world tour’! Of course,” she hesitated,
“Christopher is sometimes a trifle <em>set</em> in his ‘ideas’ about
how things ought to be <em>managed</em>: but he knows <em>hundreds</em> of
‘seafaring’ men—some of them really quite <em>remarkable</em>; and
unless he should get swept <em>away</em> from us on one of his whims
of ‘perversity’, I’m <em>sure</em> he could get your schooner equipped
with something more than a coat!”</p>

<p>Curry’s delight was almost speechless. He ardently scribbled
his San Francisco address on one of his cards, and she
put it carefully away inside her bag—a large and complex
bag, which the beholder could not but assume entered conspicuously
into the manipulation of a complex existence.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Flora, full of her new theme, went straight to her brother
about it that very evening. “Oh, Chris—such an interesting
<em>impresario</em>—clear around the world in a schooner: the <i>Skimming
Duckie</i>, or something like that—quite daring and
<em>original</em>”—it was just a little breathless and sketchy at first.
But her brother bantered, in his freezing way: “You make it
all crystal clear, Flora. A schooner?” And then he shouted.
He did not laugh, he shouted. It was a little uncouth; but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Captain liked to be a little uncouth sometimes. It helped
him with the sea captain atmosphere, which, after all, as has
been suggested, wasn’t quite a native emanation. Utterbourne
had perhaps out of sheer perversity taken to the sea, and made
a success of it; yet he had a meditative, quizzical trend of
mind, and leaned a little to hesitancies, a great deal to
analysis. He was an enigma of the first water; yet to those
who knew him best it sometimes seemed as though he possessed
the heart of a mystic—almost of a poet.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” was the upshot of the talk, “if you like. I’m
busy—h’m? But tell him to phone in for an appointment.”
The tone was one of cold generosity, which never failed more
or less to frighten the listener—a stab of formality that not
even his own sister could hope to escape.</p>

<p>But she didn’t mind in the least, even though she may
have been a little frightened. She just arched her fine brows
gratefully and said: “Thank you so <em>much</em>, Chris! You’ll
<em>never</em> regret it, I <em>know</em>, and he’s really quite <em>celebrated</em>, in a
way—though I presume the ‘world tour’ will add a great
deal to his <em>fame</em>!” And her hand rested a moment upon
her brother’s responseless arm.</p>

<p>Well, in no time at all the excited impresario was phoning
for an appointment. Then he called at the smoky offices of
the Hyde Packet company, which he brightened enormously
with his glowing, optimistic enthusiasm. Utterbourne, from
the first, of course, looked upon Flora’s new friend as a figure
of comedy; nevertheless it only showed a little in the quivering
of his lips; and he knew of a skipper, he said—a Captain
Bearman—who might be prevailed upon to take hold,
in case he happened to be without a ship just now.</p>

<p>Luck was kind. Captain Bearman was very much without
a ship, and, in his own rather acid fashion, seized almost
avidly upon the opportunity at hand. His fashion, it developed,
was full of snarls and shrouded in a rind of perpetual
crustiness. But he was an authentic sea captain, notwithstanding,
and the impresario rejoiced over him ardently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>A little dinner was arranged at the Pavillon d’Orient—an
Armenian resort famous for its skewered meats and imported
cheeses. Utterbourne actually came himself, and brought
Bearman along; while, out of the warm abundance of his
generosity the impresario invited a certain young clerk of his
acquaintance. (“He’s got such a shut-in, humdrum look.”)
And there was champagne, which more or less went to the
clerk’s head, and made him feel, for the time-being, a person
of considerable consequence.</p>

<p>Naturally Utterbourne talked of everything under the sun
except the subject that had brought them together. He spoke
poisingly of fate and art and habit and flayed immortality
within an inch of its life and said “H’m?” a great many
times and hummed <cite>To a Wild Rose</cite>. And when, later on,
Curry referred to the merchandise which the <i>Skipping Goone</i>
would carry by way of defraying expenses as a “sideline,”
then Utterbourne drawled over his shish kébab: “It’s to be
presumed we all have our sidelines, of one sort and another—h’m?
With some it’s gambling, with others art, literature,
some branch of scientific research—h’m? With most of us,
perhaps, it’s just women”—more sea captain atmosphere.</p>

<p>But Curry staunchly defended his sideline—said it had
come to him in Oshkosh while he was directing the last
act of the <cite>Gondoliers</cite> one night—really an inspiration, nothing
short of that! And Utterbourne said “Yes,” while the other
captain, out of a flaming profusion of auburn whiskers, echoed
it: “Er—yes,” with a most curious, quick little side-glance
of his narrow green eyes, which somehow instantly set him
down as a satellite.</p>

<p>Captain Bearman was big and bluff-looking, with the sea
quite oozing from his whole personality; there was even a
little gold braid, and, in spite of some rather doubtful cuffs,
he looked like an admiral; yet for all that it was only too plain
he fawned on Captain Utterbourne—and fawned very acutely.
He couldn’t seem to be obsequious and echoing enough—it
was rather baffling. He would always echo: “Er—yes,” or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
“Er—no,” as the case might be, and ordered all the dishes the
other captain ordered, and, in brief, took the cue from him
in everything.</p>

<p>At first Utterbourne by no means went out of his way to
avoid conveying the impression that the project of the
<i>Skipping Goone</i> was unseaworthy; and Captain Bearman,
simply because he possessed what the psychologists call an “inferiority
complex,” and though it might mean a lapsing of his
present opportunity, made his embittered lips curl in sympathetic
disdain. But as the impresario climbed to higher and
ever higher levels of honest zeal, gradually Utterbourne thawed
somewhat, leaning negligently back, his knife prying about
the base of his goblet, often rather gravely menacing its equilibrium;
and at once, of course, the other captain began to
thaw too. From that time on the prospects were ever so
much better.</p>

<p>Of course Xenophon Curry was an enthusiast, and of course
the champagne had made him exhort a good deal about the
supreme virtue of his songbirds (“It’s not that they’ve all got
million dollar voices, for I can’t keep that kind; but they’ve
all got million dollar hearts!”) And of course he talked a
little wildly about his great dream—New York and the
capitals of Europe.... Yet the serene and glacial Captain
Utterbourne felt in spite of himself a little touched,
and merely thought it expedient at last to observe, his voice
slipping out between reluctant lips like a thin ribbon of lazy
ice: “You must take care, Mr. Curry—h’m?—not to let a
possible material success ... I mean,” he cleared his throat
with faint petulance, “you mustn’t let your sideline turn you
into a rival of ours rather than of Gatti Cassazza’s.”</p>

<p>It was finally settled, and Bearman became the master
of the <i>Skipping Goone</i>, and the radiant impresario, as he
hailed a taxi for the entire party by way of ending the evening
in a blaze of style, cried: “The schooner will turn the trick—you’ll
see!”</p>

<p>In a word, it was nothing short of a triumph.</p>

<span class="smaller">STEALING THE THUNDER FROM IRMENGARDE</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Meantime, Elsa Utterbourne’s ball had certainly
proved the turning point for Stella! All at once
her life seemed packed with romance, and the bewildered
girl who had rebelled so bitterly against the eventlessness
of everything hadn’t time half to realize the wonders
that were taking place.</p>

<p>The whole house seemed the brighter for Stella’s having
gone to the party. Yes, even near-sighted Ted smiled quite
knowingly after Maud had whispered a mysterious something
in his ear behind the pantry door—for Maud was shrewder
than most people imagined, despite her fatal plainness. She
had guessed there were happy secrets in the air.</p>

<p>As for Stella—she refused to give in to those darker
promptings which suggested that Mr. King might, alas,
have been merely amusing himself, and had no intention
really of calling. No, it was too wonderful to turn out thus.
Even Irmengarde would be thrilled—she couldn’t help herself.</p>

<p>The evening after the party Jerome came, and wanted to
make it up. “I don’t see what I’ve done all of a sudden,” he
said, “to make you turn against me like this!” And a
moment later he was assuring her, with most unusual vigour,
that he didn’t intend to let a girl throw him down just because
she “gets an idea in her head.” Indeed, as he urged his
cause, Jerome looked quite roused and fiery. He rather
amazed her, and finally, by way of overwhelming climax,
produced a ring. “I got to thinking,” he covered it very
simply. “Not such a big stone, of course—the big ones cost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
like a house and lot. But the clerk at Ascher’s said we could
trade it in toward a larger one any time, and he told me it was
a good little diamond, even if it’s not so very showy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jerome—!” She clasped her hands in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Let’s see how it fits!” he pleaded.</p>

<p>So she let him slip it on to her finger—how life galloped!
And after that—well, since she knew less now than ever
which way to turn, Stella ended by consenting to keep the
ring, at least until she’d definitely made up her mind. Tenderness
and remorse and tears nearly overcame her. “You
must let me think.... I—I’ll send you a note!” Her eyes
were soft with romance. And they kissed—for one may
kiss, even if one doesn’t know which way to turn.</p>

<p>From the time he left her until the next morning when the
florist’s boy arrived, Stella’s mind was indeed in a state of
quandary, and Jerome had at least a fair fighting chance.
However, the florist’s boy brought a small but authentic box of
violets, and a note from Mr. King written on the stationery of
Captain Utterbourne’s club; he was going to call that evening!
And then—had Jerome but known it as he sat poring over the
ledger, he might just as well have withdrawn from the arena
altogether.</p>

<p>The only drawback, except that Mr. King must necessarily
learn what a shabby house she lived in, was the fact that
Stella would have to receive him in the same gown she had
worn to the ball, and which fortunately hadn’t yet been returned.
Nothing in her wardrobe would suffice. However,
capable Maud found that the neck of Elsa’s gown could be
temporarily built up with a bit of chiffon so that it would
appear a less formal creation; and in fact, her mouth
mumblingly impeded with pins, Maud very soon proved
how surprisingly it might be disguised as another gown altogether.</p>

<p>Just at the last minute Stella ran to her sister and pressed
a tiny package into her hand. “Won’t you please ask Ted to
run around to the Stewarts’ and give this to Jerome? There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
won’t be any answer—he’ll understand.” Then she turned
up the gas in the parlour and sat in glittering state to receive
her caller.</p>

<p class="tb">After a quarter of an hour of more or less breathless readjustment,
the situation began to show signs of growing
manageable. His ample charm and magnetism carried
everything before them. Their talk led them by degrees into
a simpler intimacy than it had been possible to establish
at the ball. He told her, discreetly, more of his romantic
life; and she managed to tell him of her life, too, without
quite letting the cat out of the bag—that is, without quite
letting him see that what she showed him was the wistful
all.... He left with reluctance, but they were to meet again
the next afternoon, at the matinée.</p>

<p>The house was still and dark; yet she was partly mistaken
in deciding all the family were asleep at the time of Mr.
King’s departure. Hardly had she turned out her light on an
image in the glass which had become strangely tolerable,
when she heard slippered feet, and Maud was kneeling beside
the bed, searching her hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, Stella!” she whispered in tones of throbbing and
unselfish delight, “I think Mr. King’s just <em>grand</em>, dear!”</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>It all seemed so bewildering—so utterly incredible. They
went to the matinée. They strolled in Golden Gate Park and
watched the swans and laughed a great deal over hot tamales
on the beach. He became a frequent caller—and sometimes
it seemed to the delighted girl that the florist’s box was even
more frequent. He seemed to know so expertly how everything
should be done: such intoxicating manners, such style!
He seemed to have dropped right from the skies into her
dazzled heart. From this time forward her little romance
moved swiftly indeed.</p>

<p>Before she had half time to realize—yes, even <em>begin</em> to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
realize—what was really taking place, he had asked her to become
his wife. “You’re the first girl I’ve cared enough for,”
was the way he phrased it; though it goes without saying that
a man of Mr. King’s temperament must more or less have
cared for a good many girls in his day. “I guess I can manage
to make you happy, little girl,” he assured her, with a
certain splendid imperiousness, “though perhaps you might
come to long for a more settled life....” He had just
arrived from a secret conference with Captain Utterbourne
under the shadow of an august map of the world. But of
course Stella was up in arms at once: “I never want to stop!
I want to go on and on, out in the world, seeing new things,
meeting new people...!” And, in his graceful way, he
allowed her to carry the point.</p>

<p>Oh, life! Oh the forces of life—and the world—and
human destiny!</p>

<p>“I just have to blush right to his face every time he looks
at me, he <em>is</em> so handsome!” was one of Aunt Alice’s voluble
confidences shared by Maud out in the kitchen. “I’ve got
a psychic feeling he’s just the one for our little Stella, and
yet don’t it beat all! My gracious, Maud, you’d think he’d
never look at any one less than a countess! And his side
view makes me think of a picture I saw once in the paper of
a man who was going to marry a duchess!”</p>

<p>Oh, life! Oh the forces of life—and the world—and
human destiny!</p>

<p class="tb">The afternoon was idyllic. Mr. King and Stella were sitting
together before a tiny fire, and there was tea. It was
very cosy and romantic. She had been doing some mending
before he came, and had hurriedly laid her basket aside.
Breaking off in the midst of a very glowing description of the
Riviera when at its gayest, however, he suddenly begged her
to go on with her sewing. She demurred, naturally: “It’s
such awfully plain and uninteresting work!” But he insisted
that it completed the “domestic picture,” and added: “You
don’t know how charming it is to see a woman sitting before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
the fire busy with needlework.” At length she complied;
but it vaguely alarmed the girl. “All I want to do is to get
away!” she cried throwing her arms wide, though she still
grasped the garment she was mending, bringing it thus a little
whimsically into the gesture. “What you’ve told me of your
life sounds so wonderful!” she sighed happily.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s adventurous,” he conceded. And then he asked
her: “What does your father think about it?”</p>

<p>“Why, what could he think but what every one thinks?”</p>

<p>King might have asked, not perhaps egregiously or unreasonably,
what every one did think; but he merely amplified:
“I had in mind my immediate prospects.”</p>

<p>“With Captain Utterbourne?”</p>

<p>“Yes—and its having to be handled in so hushed and confidential
a way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but to me the mystery—that is the most wonderful
part!” she cried. “I love having everything mysterious!”</p>

<p>He gave her hand a little squeeze, and she looked up at
him, happily thrilled. She pictured herself going through
life with him like this, thrilled, always thrilled, each day full
of delicious mystery and romance.</p>

<p>He began murmuring a bit of nursery jingle, which
sounded in her charmed ears like the rarest music:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Curly Locks, Curly Locks, wilt thou be mine?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou shalt not wash dishes nor feed the swine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But sit on a cushion and sew a fine seam,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And feast upon strawberries, sugar, and cream!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, I wonder,” she laughed softly, “—will it really be
like that? How did this wonderful thing ever happen to
me?”</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>As he rather suspected, Mr. King was destined to encounter
a brief impediment in the person of Stella’s father. Who
was Mr. King? What did any one really know about him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
and why so much mystery about the future? But the answer
was always simply: “Why, Utterbourne—your old friend
Captain Utterbourne.” Mr. Meade’s position was certainly
not a simple one, especially since he seemed to be the only one
attempting, even hesitatingly, to stand in the way of true love.
And, though he tried to see the situation all clearly and advise
what seemed best, the worst of it was he felt Mr. King’s peculiar
fascination, too, in a sense, and so seemed unable to make
up his mind as to the values of an unusual situation.</p>

<p>“Stella,” he said, in his grave way, “are <em>you</em> sure—that’s the
point—<em>dead</em> sure, girlie?”</p>

<p>And Stella was thinking excitedly: “If father really makes
a fuss, we’ll elope!” It was just the tang of fire which completed
the romance of this whole unbelievable circumstance.</p>

<p>Captain Utterbourne, as a matter of fact, was inclined, in
his faintly quizzical and even petulant way, to dissuasion,
when he learned the length to which affairs had run. He
tried delicately to ease his mind. Meade was so simple.</p>

<p>“King’s all right, of course—h’m? Though perhaps romantic....”
It was as near as he could come to uttering
platitudes like Iago. “The trouble with King is, he’s too
irresistible. How he’s managed to escape all these years is
beyond my comprehension! I must say,” the Captain complained,
“it’s something of a calamity he should have chosen
this particular time—h’m? But the man, it seems, refuses to
listen to reason, just as the woman refuses. However,” he
added, in a thin, hand-washing tone, “from your point of view I
can see how it may appear something of a catch—h’m?”
And he left, humming <cite>To a Wild Rose</cite>.</p>

<p>But at length the creases were quite ironed out. Mr. Meade
called King into the back parlour and told him it was all
right—though his voice broke just a little as he added: “I only
want my girl to be happy.”</p>

<p>They were definitely to be married, and Stella naturally
didn’t have time for anything any more. Even sleep was an
indulgence almost crowded out. How life tore along!</p>

<p>One day she unexpectedly met Jerome downtown. The contrast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
between them was really startling. It seemed unbelievable
a man so hopelessly obscure and a girl so conspicuously
important could have been engaged to each other only a few
short weeks ago. What a pace she had gone! But Jerome,
with the clip on his tie and his jaunty little pipe between his
lips, looked more than ever irrevocably fixed in a certain niche.
He tried still to flatter his ego into believing that, despite appearances,
Stella would be the heavier loser; but such flattery
was obviously growing harder every day.</p>

<p>When they met, Stella was bound for a tea engagement with
Elsa. Indeed, just as they were speaking, Elsa herself came
along.</p>

<p>“Ah?” she said, with cool uplifting voice and cool down-drooping
eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, am I late, Elsa?”</p>

<p>“No. But even if you were, a bride-to-be is always forgiven
anything.” She gave Jerome a glancing look.</p>

<p>“I’d like you to meet my friend Miss Utterbourne,” said
Stella, turning to Jerome, and feeling that the situation might
possibly develop embarrassments.</p>

<p>The two nodded formally, Elsa’s eyes merely drooping a
little more. Then Jerome felt so profoundly unhappy that he
just mumbled something, raised his hat, and left them. But
as he walked he unconsciously straightened his shoulders a
little, and held his head surprisingly high.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the young man you threw over, Stella?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we were engaged for awhile,” Stella replied with a
tone of attempted lightness.</p>

<p>Elsa gazed after him. “Something tells me you’ll never
see <em>him</em> again.”</p>

<p>Her friend appeared rather startled. “What do you mean,
Elsa?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” the other shrugged. “The way his back
looked, I guess. Things come to me like that, and I always
speak them out.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean he might do something—something desperate?”
faltered Stella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>Then Elsa laughed. “No, little one, you miss my meaning.
What I meant was he’d never give you another chance.” She
chuckled cryptically.</p>

<p class="tb">“I suppose, in a way, it does look like rushing into matrimony,”
observed Stella happily, sipping her tea and trying to
be convincingly sophisticated.</p>

<p>Elsa stared in her blank way. “Everybody admits he’s
wonderful,” she etched. “Still, to be perfectly frank, it does
seem somewhat pell-mell, even assuming the man to be wealthy
and—well, a kind of prince.” Her eyes were whimsical. But
since Mr. King had to dash away to parts unknown in the
<i>Star of Troy</i>, without giving any one a chance to catch one’s
breath, was there anything to be done about it, after all?
“Parts unknown,” mused Elsa. Yes, rather a complete mystery,
all round.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you any more about it, Elsa, because I don’t
know any more. Hasn’t your father even mentioned it?”</p>

<p>Elsa smiled with not a little of the parental cynicism, though
it flickered more warmly upon her kindlier mouth and in her
cow-brown eyes. “I haven’t a bit of pull, dear child. The
Captain, though he’s a sort of an old dear, is just about as
communicative as a clam, even with me.”</p>

<p>“Whenever I say anything about it all,” admitted Stella,
but with shining eyes, “Ferdinand tells me to remember what
happened in the case of Lohengrin. What did happen, do you
remember?” she smiled.</p>

<p>Still, though she had coaxed very prettily at times, especially
toward the last, she had also come, perhaps even a bit
consciously, as the closer intimacy developed, to live up to that
doll-like ideal King seemed rather to nurse in his high-sailing
heart. “Leave everything to me, little lady,” he had urged, in
his magnetic, irresistible fashion. “Never you worry that dear
little head of yours about business. It doesn’t belong in a
woman’s sphere. Does it, peaches? You just leave things to
me, and if we’re successful in this deal, I’ll take you to Paris
and buy you all the hats in the rue de la Paix!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Elsa warned her young friend against “letting any man
make a ninny” of her. “You seem to be quite hypnotized,
Stella. It’s all very well,” she observed, her eyes drooping so
much that it looked as though she were pulling the corners
down with her fingers, “to let a man think he can run his business
without you to begin with. They always lead off like
that. But unless you mean to be a traitor to your sex, you
can’t begin too soon letting it be known (I don’t care if he <em>is</em> a
prince!) that the old lord-and-master idea has been converted
into a sieve.” She paused, then smilingly dropped in an
extra lump. “It’s because I refuse to be a traitor that I’m no
longer wearing my engagement ring.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Stella in real dismay.</p>

<p>Elsa held up the vacant finger with a philosophic grimace.</p>

<p>“But—”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not go into it now, if you don’t mind,” she
half yawned. “It’s rather a boring business, and I’m trying to
forget I was ever such a fool as to be taken in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Elsa—after starting off so splendidly—the
dance....”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t it better to wake up now than too late? Besides,
it’s merely an episode. Love is only an episode, little
one. Don’t you hang on so hard to your dangerous ideals!”</p>

<p>And she reached across and pinched Stella’s cheek in her
vaguely rough way.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>The wedding was a very quiet and modest affair—a little
quieter and more modest, to tell the truth, than <em>quite</em> appealed
to Stella’s ambitious notions of grandeur, though it was a
church wedding, too, with a small reception afterward.</p>

<p>Of course every one was tremendously impressed by the
bridegroom, and everybody said how sweet the bride looked.
Aunt Alice wept happy tears on people’s shoulders, and between
whiles talked faster than any one else.</p>

<p>Meade gave his daughter away, and looked very proud,
though also a little pathetic in his dress suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>There were all sorts of nice gifts for the bride, most of
which, for the time being, would have to be left behind. And
one of the gifts gave Stella a real momentary, ungraspable
heartache. It was a small cut-glass fruit bowl, and within
lay a blank card on which, in cramped scrawl, appeared the
single word: Jerome.</p>

<span class="smaller">LIKE THE BARQUE OF CLEOPATRA</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">She was now Mrs. Ferdinand King, and had sailed away
in Captain Utterbourne’s <i>Star of Troy</i> on a honeymoon
full of mystery—one destined to carry her not even she
knew whither or how far. But Jerome just remained a clerk
immersed in the dust and antiquity of Oaks, Ferguson &amp; Whitley’s.</p>

<p>He told himself he must keep up a worldly front behind
which he could hide his great unhappiness. This attempt
found expression in a certain rather superficial cockiness,
valiantly aided and abetted by the jaunty little pipe. But
he had lost the one girl he ever really cared for, and felt
the loss bitterly. With Stella seemed to go out, too, forever,
that dream of hearth and kiddies to which he had clung
so lovingly and so long. He could not show these things,
however. And his ego, though not morbidly sensitive or
in the least vindictive, was still squirming—it was all pretty
complex.</p>

<p>During this unhappy period his defensive cheerfulness was
made vaguely easier by a somewhat surprising friendship
which had developed between himself and the picturesque
impresario. After the visit to the schooner, and certainly
after the dinner, the impresario might very logically have
dropped from his horizon; nevertheless, Jerome went right
on seeing him at odd times and places—and, most notably,
had been permitted to attend several rehearsals. These were
naturally dazzling experiences, which gave the clerk glimpses
of a wholly new world and brought him into vivid if momentary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
contact with men and women who, in their blithe,
impressively sophisticated manner, appeared to know about
all there was to know about life.</p>

<p>Some of the songbirds, it is true, rather kidded the impresario
for taking up with the young clerk; and one of
the singers, the official comedian of the company, worked
up a highly successful imitation, which became one of the
best things he did. Yet of course when he appeared upon
the scene, Mr. Curry’s new friend was treated with tremendous
respect.</p>

<p>As for Jerome, he thought the members of the troupe
without exception splendid; and, partly, no doubt, as a
means of easing the distress in his heart, even began telling
himself he was growing positively infatuated with a certain
girl who did a few small rôles, but mostly sang in the chorus.
Her name was Lili—an extraordinary creature, with great
wide, bewitching, wicked light brown eyes which were always
beaming; a mouth that existed only for eating and loving;
a wealth of rich massed hair and—well, nobody ever did
know how much there was underneath it—perhaps a very
great deal, for Lili was deep, in her way, despite genuinely
child-like qualities. She was a truly delightful person, impulsive
and affectionate and a trifle flighty, with a healthy
desire to be a prima donna.</p>

<p>Lili used to amuse herself, when Jerome came amongst
them, by beaming on the poor clerk till he had to blink and
would grow quite red. She had a way of gradually opening
her eyes wider and wider as she beamed, which produced
a really electric effect and would make any one’s pulse,
pre-eminently the pulse of a clerk who had never been beamed
on that way before, double and treble its accustomed
beat. He didn’t dream it was she who laughed most heartily
over the efforts of the comedian, and that she herself one
day took round a petition, drawn up by the comedian, requesting
signatures of all the male members of the troupe
who would agree to adopt fashion’s latest mandate: a patent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
clip to hold down the ends of one’s tie and keep one’s
shoulders from growing too haughty.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>With everything vigorously under way, and the actual sailing
day in sight, Xenophon Curry was calling on his friend
and benefactress, Flora Utterbourne, to express for perhaps
the hundredth time his overwhelming gratitude. He stirred
his tea happily and looked about the little drawing room
which Flora had made so much her own with the assistance
of sales and auctions. Glancing about one understood Flora’s
success.</p>

<p>The tea things stood between them on the very gate-legged
table acquired at Crawl Hill, and in which the impresario
insisted upon feeling a whimsical part interest. Flora had
just returned from a luncheon party—they had met, as a
matter of fact, on her threshold—and as they sipped and
chatted she informally lifted off a hat of faun straw and
figured silk, thrusting the pins back into it, with the veil still
where it had been brushed up out of the way across the
crown. She laid the hat aside and touched her hair comfortably.
His response to the geniality of this hour of early
twilight, with a small clock ticking somewhere, was very
whole-hearted, though of course sentimental, because everything
about the impresario was sentimental.</p>

<p>Some turn or other in the talk presently brought up the
subject of his rings. “I’ve been <em>noticing</em> them,” she smiled.
“It seems to me I’ve never seen so many—and some of the
‘stones’ seem quite <em>wonderful</em>!”</p>

<p>“I know,” he laughed, “there are a good many more than
there ought to be, but I get so attached to each new one that
drops into my hands, I couldn’t bear to give any of ’em up.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” she exclaimed. “Do they really come
as easily as all <em>that</em>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” he confided, “it’s become a sort of custom
that when one of my songbirds is offered a contract by one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
of the big managers and has to leave me—and I want to
tell you I’ve discovered more than one now famous star and
given the boost to begin with!—then I get a ring in remembrance.
Sometimes it will be a great big stone—like this one,
you see? Then again a more modest size, like this one.
It depends,” he added confidentially, “a little on the contract;
but I love every single ring on my fingers exactly the same,
because each one stands for a songbird.”</p>

<p>“A songbird who has flown away,” she murmured, her
fine eyes a little sad.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he sighed. “But it can’t be helped, and it doesn’t
mean, you know, that they don’t go right on being loyal.
We all have to make our way in the world. Lord, if it isn’t
one thing it’s another! Money’s the main difficulty, and
what can you hope to do if you never had any?”</p>

<p>Ah, what indeed? The impresario set down his cup
thoughtfully; and a moment later she sympathetically brought
out her own special phase of that curious irony they had
spoken of at the auction. “No one would <em>think</em>, to see how
‘entrenched’ we look, that I’d be out of here, ‘bag and baggage,’
early in the <em>morning</em>!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Mr. Curry, really quite shaken.</p>

<p>She nodded and smiled at him over a slice of caramel
cake she was nibbling.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow!”</p>

<p>“It’s really heart-<em>breaking</em>,” she admitted slowly, “though
when I’ve had time to grow a little interested in the new
‘apartment’ it won’t matter. But it did strike me as so <em>irresistibly</em>
funny, sitting here with you ‘over the teacups,’
that at eight o’clock the men will be at the door for my
<em>trunks</em>!”</p>

<p>Suddenly he leaned toward her with great earnestness.
“Miss Utterbourne, I want to ask you a favour.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” Her brows were arched in cordial interrogation.</p>

<p>“It—it’s about this table—table we bought,” he said,
quite steadily despite the brazen pronoun, and fixing her
with his honest, eager gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“Of <em>course</em>,” she laughed softly, and with a subtle note of
warm joyousness, “I’ve <em>always</em> thought of it as ‘our’ table!
I shall never <em>think</em> of it otherwise!”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to ask you,” he continued, earnestly thumping
with one sparkling finger, “not to leave the table
behind.” She coloured a little, and he pressed on: “I want
you to take it with you to the new apartment for a kind
of nucleus—to begin building around!”</p>

<p>“Ah,” she sighed lightly, but with a gently glowing
graciousness, “you’re a diabolical tempter at my <em>elbow</em>, for
I’m sure you know my weakness for ‘gate-legged’ tables!”</p>

<p>“I guess I have a weakness for them, too,” he admitted
doggedly.</p>

<p>“Well,” she laughed, blushing still more happily, “then
I’m afraid the table <em>will</em> have to go along, <em>really</em>, though
I’m sure the people who are subletting will <em>notice</em>! What
would sound most <em>plausible</em>, do you think?” She was growing
quite excited. “For it would hardly do to tell quite
the facts—<em>would</em> it?”</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Meantime, the <i>Skipping Goone</i> was taking on a lively
appearance indeed, as the great sailing day drew close. She
had hugged her wharf so long in apathetic solitude that it
had begun to look as though she might be destined just
to settle down in the peaceful calm of the harbour for the
remainder of her days. She seemed a little weary and careless
of reputation. Small urchins of the wharf played
familiarly all over her decks, while a shore cat, who would
have raised her paws in horror at the thought of becoming
a ship’s cat, had strayed aboard through pardonable misapprehension
and become parent to a generous brood of
kittens. The hawsers had taken on a staid and permanent
look. But lo! a great change was come about, and the
<i>Skipping Goone</i> strained at her moorings, ready to launch
forth upon the most strenuous period of her career.</p>

<p>It was at length the very eve of departure. Jerome had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
been feeling very sad, with the hour of severance so nearly
arrived; but as the night wore on he felt less and less sad
in proportion to the augmenting glasses of claret poured
out for him by the incomparable Lili, who, herself in a
distinctly uplifted state, didn’t leave off beaming at all. His,
just now, were sensations he could wish to prolong into an
eternity; they eased his hurt at the same time that they
encouraged in him a feeling that he might, if he would,
cut a tremendous figure in life. Could Stella look in upon
him now here in the dazzling midst of Girardin’s French
table d’hôte, surrounded by gay opera singers making the
most of their last night on shore, she would think there had
been strides since the day they had quarrelled in the fog.</p>

<p>“Pass the bottle along down, dear old dear!” somebody
shouted.</p>

<p>All things considered, it was a remarkably democratic aggregation
of songbirds. Naturally when he boasted about
its being one big family, the impresario exaggerated a
little; for of course there was a perpetual swarm of petty
jealousies and artistic differences—though what are most
families like, anyhow? By and large, the troupe was an extraordinary
model of ruined caste.</p>

<p>When the fun was at its height, Curry waved a gem-encrusted
hand, gave his songbirds a departing smile, and
removed himself to a distant corner of the restaurant where
he could spread out all those “dreadful lists and things”
which Captain Bearman insisted must be checked up. His
retreat was deplored by a prodigious groan, and impulsively
covered by Lili, who chased after him with a slopping
goblet of wine and a depleted plate of sandwiches. “So
you won’t starve to death, old dear!” And she flung her
arms spontaneously round his neck before returning to beam
upon her clerk.</p>

<p>“You’d think it ought to be an easy thing to run a
schooner,” Curry smiled up wanly at M. Girardin, who had
strolled over from his little cash booth in a relaxed mood.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
“But Lord! there’s been nothing but trouble from the word
go!” Captain Bearman was turning out to be a master full
of whines and unforeseen exactions. There had been endless
fault to find with the <i>Shipping Goone</i>. “What a vessel!
Sails rotten, hull rotten! Rudder in the last stages!”
Apparently there was nothing quite right about the poor
old <i>Skipping Goone</i>, of which the impresario had been so
proud, except perhaps the new coat of paint—and even the
colour of that had been grumblingly objected to as unnautical.
“And then,” Girardin was told, “the cargo!”</p>

<p>“But <i lang="fr">mon dieu</i>, do you intend to handle it all yourself?
Have you no business manager, <i lang="fr">par example</i>?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps not in the strict sense,” admitted Mr. Curry
in his petitioning, confidential way. “There’s a sort of
treasurer—you see that man just waving the bottle? But
he just handles the box office receipts. Then I’ve got a kind
of assistant, too, who’s supposed to do things; but he’s been
so crazy to go on the stage that I’ve had to let him sing in
the chorus, and that seems to make him not much good
for anything else.”</p>

<p>An unusual amount of commotion on the other side of
the restaurant made them look across. Most of the troupers
had had sense, but a few were in a very mellow condition—notably
Jerome, who wasn’t used to stimulants and so reacted
to them with awful completeness. The songbirds
were grouped in a crowding and boisterous circle. One of
the men was whistling a jig tune, and several were clapping
their hands in syncopated time, while in the centre,
very much flushed and largely unable to keep his balance,
was Jerome, doing the sailor’s hornpipe.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>In the cold grey dawn of the great sailing day, shadowy
figures began going aboard the <i>Skipping Goone</i>. The city
delivered them up. Then gradually the city awoke, and
the waterfront went about its usual occupations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>As morning advanced, the <i>Skipping Goone</i> became a
setting for some of the wildest scenes in the history of
opera in America. Red-eyed sopranos were bumped by
stevedores; a stout lady whose forte was contralto matrons,
went madly about in search of a trunk. Sailors were puttering,
while Captain Bearman croaked out sullen orders
through his beautiful flaming whiskers. Finally, the lord
of all commotion, Xenophon Curry, who was sure, yes
desperately and perspiringly sure, half the important things
had been forgotten.</p>

<p>And of course Flora Utterbourne was on hand to see them
off. She walked right aboard the <i>Skipping Goone</i>, her face
smilingly full of every good wish for the impresario as she
stood beside him on deck conversing with unbroken animation,
yet always in that fluid, gliding manner which he
knew so well now. Yes, Flora in her speech flowed on like
a gracious river. And there was just a faint sadness behind
her frank gaze, which meant that this departure was
going to leave an unexpected emptiness. However, if there
was sadness in her gaze, there was sadness also in the impresario’s.
Xenophon Curry, though borne up by unquenchable
optimism, realized that it was going to be surprisingly
hard to say good-bye—maybe for years or a lifetime—to
the lady who had asked him the way to Crawl Hill.</p>

<p>The <i>Skipping Goone</i> looked small and a little pathetic
this morning. What was in store for them in the wide, wild
ocean?</p>

<p>A crowd was waving on the wharf. The last perfervid
farewells had been said, and the singers went about nibbling
bon voyage chocolates, defiant of <i lang="fr">mal de mer</i>.
There were flowers, there was even confetti. The drab old
schooner had taken on a very festive look indeed—almost
like the barque of Cleopatra!</p>

<p>Every hand clutched a handkerchief, every handkerchief
sought its niche in the vibrating atmosphere. A tenor tried
his voice behind the deckhouse and emerged singing <cite>Auld
Lang Syne</cite>. The last hawser was cast off. A tug hooted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>And so it was that the <i>Skipping Goone</i> in her brave
new paint, bearing a mixed cargo of merchandise and
songbirds, gay with flutter and bloom, was trundled off
down the bay and out upon the heaving vast, bound for parts
remote and adventures cloaked in an impenetrable veil.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE AWAKENING</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">The first thing of which Jerome was conscious was
a feeling that the covers had slid off. They sometimes
did, for he was a trifle too long for his bed and
frequently threshed the blankets loose at the foot.</p>

<p>Yes, he dully decided, without yet definitely opening his
eyes at all, that the bed clothes must have slid off onto the
floor. He felt chilly, yet not so chilly as to force him to
any really energetic effort toward a recovery of the obstreperous
quilt. He groped futilely about with one hand,
then gave it up. There seemed to be something desperately
wrong with his head. He couldn’t seem to concentrate—no,
not even on the quilt.</p>

<p>Some time later he again emerged into a realm of hazy
half-consciousness, and began remembering, very sketchily,
the crimson night out of which the present condition had
evolved; saw once more the boisterous gathering at Girardin’s,
with himself in the midst; seemed still to feel Lili beaming
at him in her wonderful way. Then it came to him that he
had finally succumbed to prolonged persuasion and had done
his little stunt. He blushed unhappily and told himself
his dignity was now permanently shattered. How had
they managed so to overcome his every better scruple?
Girardin’s—he had lost all count of the number of glasses—everybody
so jolly—Lili—the way she looked at one....
He groaned. Then he remembered that by now she must
be far to sea. What time was it? What time? It seemed
very dusky. He couldn’t hear his alarm clock on the
commode. Of course—it hadn’t been wound. He had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
gone out and made a night of it, and his clock had run down.</p>

<p>And then—then he blinked his eyes a little and began,
very dully at first, to establish a groping connection with
the objects they encountered. The particular object which
first arrested his attention was a crack which ran in a perfectly
straight line across the ceiling over his head. It puzzled
him, rather, because he couldn’t remember any such
crack as this in his ceiling. There were plenty of cracks,
but all zig-zag. Curious, how he had managed to sleep all
these years under a perfectly straight crack without ever
seeing it!</p>

<p>He groaned again and shut his eyes. These puzzling inconsistencies
made his head rock more and more acutely.
He tried to turn over and go back to sleep—tried to put
all that was baffling out of his wretched head. But the one
query that now kept at him with dogged persistence was:
how did he ever get to bed without being able to remember
a single circumstance connected with the process?</p>

<p>His next discovery was that he had gone to bed in his clothes.
His hand encountered the clip which still staunchly held his
tie in place. The clip proved beyond possible doubt that
he wasn’t in his customary nightshirt. And then—ah, but
then the action seemed speeded up enormously!</p>

<p>His eyes were wide now; he was growing sober by leaps
and bounds. There was the undeviating crack above his
head, and six inches to either side of it were identical cracks.
The ceiling wasn’t composed of plaster at all, but painted
boards; and the most staggering thing about it was the
fact that, without even sitting up he could stretch out his
hand and touch it! As a matter of fact, he wasn’t in any
actual bed, but on a shelf underneath a rough board cupboard.</p>

<p>And now, at last, he had reached the inevitable point of
exclaiming: “Where am I?” and sent his leaden feet hurtling
through space in the direction of the floor. He sat for
a moment on the edge of the shelf, holding his vertiginous
head in his hands and trying to steady himself to a facing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
of whatever ordeal might be in store for him. One awful
thought kept pounding against his feverish temples: “Perhaps
I’m in jail!” Mightn’t the cell of a jail conceivably
look like this?</p>

<p>But when he came face to face with a tiny port, his almost
entirely cleared though still very painful brain registered
the indisputable fact that he was at sea.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Jerome braced himself and stared out. Occasionally a
wave would slap against the glass. He had let the fishing
boats go without him. Now he was at sea!</p>

<p>He was bewildered, then scared, then more scared. Yet
underneath it all a queer little wisp of daring insinuated
itself—something almost akin to self-congratulation; and
the whimsical query leapt: “Has the whole business of
Oaks-Ferguson’s been a dream, and did I go to sea after all?”</p>

<p>The first terrible and confusing instant behind him, panic
was dominant again, and he reeled away to explore his dilemma.
Jerking open the door of the tiny cabin, which
appeared to be nothing more nor less than a supply closet,
he emerged into a stuffy corridor and groped his way toward
a flight of steps ahead which led up into daylight. As
Jerome groped toward the light it may be intimated that his
mental complex was one which must defy the most patient
attempt at analysis. When he came out at last on deck, the
whole awful, wonderful, terrifying truth flared up like a rocket:
this was the <i>Skipping Goone</i>, and he was launched, along
with the rest, on Xenophon Curry’s great world tour.</p>

<p>As for its being the <i>Skipping Goone</i>, there could be
no shadow of doubt; for here, as in a vision, with lurid
sunset in their still excited faces, were all his new theatrical
friends. He beheld at once a throng and each separate face.
There stood Xenophon Curry in his Palm Beach suit and
gay adornments, like an amazed exotic potentate, gazing
at him with dropped jaw. There was the comedian, who
always treated him with such irreproachable respect, gazing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
too. And there, with a sun-tinted sail behind her, looking,
he thought, just like some radiant goddess, was Lili. She
wasn’t beaming now, simply gazing like the rest. There
was a space of perfectly blank silence, as Jerome stood there
before them. It was decidedly an awful moment.</p>

<p>Curry was the first to break through. “Good Lord, boy!”
he cried, making futile gestures and taking almost equally
futile steps toward the very substantial looking apparition.</p>

<p>Next to break through were two singers, Tony and Alfredo,
who amazed everybody by suddenly beginning to hurl Italian
at each other in torrents. Jerome, of course, couldn’t
understand a word they said, although, even in the midst
of all the confusion, he felt somehow certain that what they
were hurling directly concerned this startling mystery of
which he had so abruptly become the centre.</p>

<p>Curry was grasping his arm. “How did you get aboard?”
he cried, a look of honest amazement supreme, now, in his
so warmly expressive face.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir,” replied Jerome in a rather weak and
husky voice.</p>

<p>Genuine pandemonium set in. It was almost a riot. But
gradually, as some semblance of law and order returned,
Tony Riforto was made out adjuring Alfredo Manuele with
the full solemnity of a wagging forefinger:</p>

<p>“You’ve got to help me think, I tell you! How can you expect
me to figure the whole thing out myself?”</p>

<p>“Figure what?” voices demanded.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” exclaimed Curry, “I begin to see—you took
him in tow—yes, it was you two—at Girardin’s—in the confusion
of closing—what then?”</p>

<p>“What then?” spluttered Alfredo. He seemed to grasp at
a ray of hope. “There was a cab!”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried the other in exultation. “I begin to remember
something—we had to take him somewhere—he’d
caved in. I remember—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” brightened Alfredo, “we couldn’t take him home.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
It would never have done, maestro—and that’s the truth indeed!”</p>

<p>No, it would never have done, as he seemed to imply, to
wake up a trustful and unsuspecting family to such a spectacle
as the clerk had then presented. No one would have had
the heart.</p>

<p>“He had fallen under the table, maestro!”</p>

<p>“Besides, how did we know where he lived?”</p>

<p>“But what then?” asked Curry, his face crowded more than
ever with a real desperation of concern.</p>

<p>“Tony,” muttered Alfredo weakly, “how was it after that?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” commanded Tony solemnly. “Maestro,
we thought it would be best to bring him aboard for the
night!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” the other brightened. “How it all comes back
to me! A few hours sleep on the schooner, and then....”</p>

<p>From the vicinity of the comedian something strangely like
an incipient chuckle was detected.</p>

<p>“Well, maestro,” faltered Tony ruefully, scarcely daring to
look at the victim at all, “after that—after that....”</p>

<p>But it was all too plain at length. “For you see,” as
Alfredo appended in his dire extremity, “we were in so much
the same fix ourselves!”</p>

<p>They stood aghast at what they had done. Everybody stood
aghast. There seemed something almost cataclysmic about
Jerome’s being here in their midst instead of back in San
Francisco where he belonged.</p>

<p>But at length delightful Lili, who had by this time shed her
amazement and awe (as in the living presence of a ghost) and
had begun to beam in quite her accustomed manner, cried out:
“The old dear!” and made for Jerome, her heart seeming
vaguely touched at the expression on his face. It was Lili
who really introduced the first ray of cheer and serenity and
humour into the situation.</p>

<p>She seized his hand. It was a perfectly solid hand. She
had held it before. Even had she had lingering suspicions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
they were now dispelled. This was no ghost. No, it was the
clerk himself.</p>

<p>And then, somehow, the humour of it all took possession of
the throng, and Lili led him about, and welcome, almost congratulation,
was showered upon him. As for Jerome, while
explanations were in progress he had looked greener and
greener; but now a grin was emerging. It was at first a
pretty sickly grin, but it helped lighten the awfulness of his
position.</p>

<p>He had to grasp at things to keep his balance—not because
he was still unsteady himself, but because the schooner was
performing such violent antics; a panic he dared not profess
made him somewhat faint. They would never cease tormenting
were the fact to come out, after his boasting the night before,
that the man who had danced the sailor’s hornpipe so
convincingly was scared. He grinned instead; and the
longer he grinned, the easier, as a matter of fact, it became.
For the present, indeed, there was nothing else he <em>could</em>
do.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it just too rich?” giggled Lili, beaming upon him
with her gay, widening eyes.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Long before the excitement over Jerome had begun to
abate, the cabin boy went about beating on a tom-tom, the
summons being met by a mixed chorus of cheers and
groans. There were those who had by this time settled
down with white, set expressions, who wished the ship would
sink, and rolled their eyes reproachfully; even a few had
crawled into their bunks and would not be seen again. But
there were also those for whom the sea would hold no discomfort
unless it became unduly incensed; Lili, anticipating
trouble, was as yet carrying on serenely, while Jerome,
rather surprisingly, felt no symptoms at all—nothing but
the sense of panic he dared not show. Every time the
schooner heeled over, Jerome mentally gasped. But there
was nothing to do but keep the grin active.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>The saloon was not quite big enough comfortably to contain
the table set to accommodate them all, and the cabin boy
who waited had to squeeze a bit here and there. But nothing
could daunt the blithe hilarity of the diners themselves, who
thrust their legs in amongst wooden horses which formed
the table’s sub-structure, and declared they’d never tasted anything
half so good as the ship’s plain fare.</p>

<p>At the head of the table, looking exactly like an admiral,
sat Captain Bearman. On his right was Miss Valentine,
who could sing up to F, while on his left was the comfortable
contralto. It was very delightfully arranged, and
should have melted the stoniest heart; yet Captain Bearman,
incessantly smoothing and fingering his flaming beard
(parted in the middle and flying grandly two ways in an
almost horizontal line) absolutely refused to unbend beyond
ungracious monosyllables. People instinctively wanted to
be impressed by him and take him for an admiral, yet he
instinctively wouldn’t let them because of that fatal sense of
his own inferiority.</p>

<p>At the foot of the table sat Xenophon Curry, his rings
flashing and his smile, of such singular sweetness, making
the whole place bright. Yes, Mr. Curry had a wonderfully
heartening and stabilizing influence. Had he been
a shade austere, or less impulsively open and human, he
could never hope to lure out a flock of songbirds and flute
players and cabaret violinists and snare drummers into the
precarious bosom of an antique schooner on a world tour
packed with the Lord alone knew what.</p>

<p>Lili had invited Jerome to sit next her, and through
dinner kept up an entrancing conversation with the clerk,
constantly patting on the back that manly and dashing phase
of his ego which insisted upon the deceptive grin, and which,
in high-handed spurts of confidence, actually began convincing
him that whatever might be the outcome he was
glad to be right where he was! Yes, glad this miracle had
befallen him. Glad he had been dumped into the supply
closet. <em>Glad</em> he was at sea—with Lili!</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Naturally the <i>Skipping Goone</i> didn’t possess a lounge in
any true ocean liner sense. But there was a rough space
aft, out of which improvised sleeping quarters opened;
and into this cabin, forlorn enough in itself, and lighted only
by a couple of very smoky lamps, had been introduced
certain truly voluptuous notes. There were benches with
bright red cushions, and—yes, there actually was a piano.
It seemed a wonderful thing indeed, coming upon a piano
in such a dismal coop of a place. But there it was—a
perky, cheap little upright, not quite full grown and
apparently lined with tin. It was shabby and perky at the
same time; Mr. Curry had purchased it at second hand,
and it looked as though it had passed through rather a
good many hands even before it reached the dealer at all.
But it was still indomitable, and possessed a red felt scarf
with an amazing border of yellow and green stitching. As
for the “soft” pedal, it no longer worked; but the “loud”
pedal was perfectly intact—and that, as the impresario
joyously pointed out to Miss Valentine, was “just fifty per
cent. better than no pedal of any description.”</p>

<p>Round the piano they gathered after dinner and made
as much merry noise as they could in an effort to keep
their spirits from sagging. It was a very different picture
from that framed by the tiny lone cabin where Captain Bearman,
surrounded by august nautical implements and with the
impressive book of the log spread open before him, sat busy
with his finger nails, gnawing them in sullen solitude. The
perky piano dominated another scene altogether. Mr. Curry
himself sat at the piano, pounding with incorrigible cheerfulness.
The drummer from Kentucky had brought out his
queer little old snare drum for the occasion—no room,
alas, for the kinglier kettles here! And the temperamental
violinist from Vienna vigorously added his best technique
to swell the melodic pleasures of the convivial hour.</p>

<p>The family of songbirds pressed close about them, bawling
old comic songs and parodies at the top of their lungs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
laughing with many symptoms of hysteria, and having the
gayest sort of time imaginable. Yes, gayety was the rule
and goal of the hour; and if any one, in a moment of unfortunate
abstraction, had struck up <cite>Home Sweet Home</cite> or
<cite>Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep</cite> there would have been
a riot indeed. The offender would have been put right off
the ship.</p>

<p>It was a glorious night—sheer and immortal—this first night
at sea. All about spread darkness and lonely ocean, with stars
burning dimly overhead. The stars looked down through
empyreans of silence and saw the <i>Skipping Goone</i> nosing
along under full sail with her romantic miscellany of merchandise
and songbirds, dogged and unafraid, conquering
through plain cheek. In the cabin with the smoky lamps
the impresario and his children blithely challenged the
elements to do their worst.</p>

<p>Jerome, of course, was in the cabin with them. “Lord,
Lord!” Curry had exclaimed, his kindly face a real pageant
of perplexity, “it’s just one of those things that happen.
Boy, it might be worse, though I guess you’re in for a little
taste of the world, eh? You’ll have to take pot luck with
us, but the Lord knows you’re welcome!” In the midst of
the spritely din Jerome and Lili were discussing the predicament.</p>

<p>“Oh,” gurgled Lili, “it will come out in all the papers:
‘Last seen departing for Girardin’s.’ What grand publicity—if
you only needed it, like me! Gawd knows I could
use a little of that kind!” Then she added: “How are you
going to let them know where you are?”</p>

<p>It was a question indeed. The comedian cupped his
hands and shouted across the hubbub: “Write a note and
put it in a bottle!” It would be somehow painfully appropriate—in
a bottle—though the chances of delivery couldn’t
be reckoned very brilliant.</p>

<p>Jerome thought of his people—his home—saw everything
perhaps more vividly than ever before in his life. If this
amazing calamity hadn’t befallen him, where would he be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
now? At the movies, probably. Yes, he was pretty likely
to be at the movies of an evening now that Stella had slipped
out of his life. It seemed unlikely he would ever have need
of the movies again!</p>

<p>Lili began singing along with the others, her strong and
somewhat brazen voice entering in with irrepressible verve.
Jerome gazed at her. His heart grew furtively undaunted.
As a matter of fact, before long the clerk was almost
openly applauding his calamity. And then he even began
looking upon it as something he had accomplished himself,
in a sense. Certainly nothing could have been accomplished
without him.</p>

<p>He had been an obscure clerk, and was an obscure clerk
no longer. What would come of all this in the end? Perplexity
held him in a rather shivery embrace. But Lili
slipped an affectionate arm through his and made him sway
with her to the rhythm.</p>

<p>She clapped time with her large, rather beautiful hands.</p>

<p>They romped from song to song, growing more abandoned
all the time. “Come on, now!” shouted the impresario
joyously, dominating in his irresistible way even the
deafening din about him. “Strong on the chorus—swell
out on the second bar, and then—piano—<em>piano</em>! Tum te

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">It was very curious to feel that he had lived with himself,
in a condition of rather close intimacy, all these
years without realizing that he was capable of supreme
emotions. Jerome didn’t feel entirely at home with himself
any more. No, to tell the truth he felt on terms of
slight formality.</p>

<p>There was, of course, no mirror in the supply closet, and,
since he had never before faced the obligation of dressing
without the aid of a mirror, Jerome spent an anxious thought
on the possibility of being unable to negotiate his cravat.
The absence of his own familiar looking glass reminded
him, over again, of the vertiginous fact that he had said
good-bye, though so informally, to all that had gone to compose
his erstwhile existence. Could he manage to reorganize
his entire life in an instant? And how could he spend
his days if not behind the counters of Oaks, Ferguson &amp;
Whitley’s? But then the more back-patting problem presented
itself: How could they ever manage without him?
Yes, this bore earmarks of a supreme emotion.</p>

<p>Carefully attaching the clip to the ends of his tie, he
snipped its pincher against the edge of his bargain counter
shirt. It signified that he was now ready for whatever the
day might hold.</p>

<p class="tb">Gradually the members of Mr. Curry’s little troupe came
straggling up into the welcome sunshine, wearing an aspect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
of determined cheerfulness—which was, indeed, beginning
to grow a bit seaworthy.</p>

<p>“Everybody happy, no bones broken,” the comedian estimated
in his twinkling way, as he went about slapping people
on the back irrespective of sex. Curiously enough—even
somewhat bafflingly—this was a comedian a great deal funnier
off the stage than on.</p>

<p>“Ah, there, Mr. Stewart!” He approached and shook
hands with tremendous respect.</p>

<p>And Jerome amazed everybody by turning, even as he
acknowledged the sober salutation, and winking broadly at
the singers who stood looking on with an edge of amusement.
The wink seemed to warn them they would have to be
guarded from now on if they were to have fun at his expense.</p>

<p>Jerome was making progress.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Lili didn’t appear at breakfast. Jerome hated to ask
about her, but at length did; and they told him, without
quite the old satirical respect, that she was lying low. It
even got to Lili that her friend had been enquiring after her;
and she sat up in her bunk and romantically scribbled him
a few lines on a bit of wrapping paper torn off a package
containing a new eleventh hour corset.</p>

<p>“Hello, old dear!” she scrawled. “How’s every little
thing? It’s a gay life if you don’t weaken! I haven’t—I’m
only taking a long beauty sleep, and if it gets calmer
I’ll meet you on deck tonight.”</p>

<p>Jerome was quite excited over the note. He had never
received a note like this before. While they were still engaged,
Stella had written him three or four letters from
Los Gatos, where she had gone on a trip in the summer;
but these letters had differed acutely from the note just received
from Lili. There was something about Lili’s note,
with its vague department store aroma, that made Jerome
tingle excitedly. He was very sure none of the clerks he
knew in Market street had ever received such a note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>There was no moon, but the stars were rich and wonderful.
She had dragged up blankets from her bunk, and sat
snug in them on deck—a trifle subdued, perhaps, by the
mighty sway of the sea, though she beamed almost
as dazzlingly as ever, her eyes opening wider and wider
in the starlight till the poor clerk was nearly beside himself.</p>

<p>She asked him if he didn’t want part of her blankets,
and he said, very earnestly, oh no, he wasn’t cold. “But
you haven’t any overcoat.” No, that was true—because he
hadn’t worn one to Girardin’s. Everything seemed to date
back to Girardin’s. “Say,” he demanded, “has it seemed long
since that night?”</p>

<p>“Has it seemed <em>long</em>!” she exclaimed. “My Gawd!”</p>

<p>“A lot can happen in a little while sometimes,” he mused.
“It seems as though more has happened since that night than
altogether in my whole life!”</p>

<p>She grabbed the clerk frantically. “I thought we were
going clear over that time! Don’t it seem so to you when
we tip so far?”</p>

<p>Sensations rather similar had not been stranger to his
own brain; indeed, furtively, once or twice earlier in the
day he had thought: “I’m a goner!” and tried to recall
a very concise prayer, and had seen his whole life drawn
into a swift, convenient synthesis; but the loyal old craft,
somehow or other, always managed to come creaking back,
and went right on about her business. “It’s perfectly safe,”
he assured her. The calm may have been egregious, but
there was a genuine throb back of his suggestion: “Would
you like me to hold onto you so you’d feel more steady?”</p>

<p>“Listen to him!” she tittered, snuggling down into her nest
and gazing over at him enticingly. She half closed her eyes
and gave him a vampire look.</p>

<p>Jerome, just then, felt as though he would be willing to
do anything in the world for Lili. Anything she might
ask. He had reached an abject phase in his romantic feeling
for her. Lili charmed and hypnotized him, made the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
blood go racing. No girl had ever affected him just this way
before.</p>

<p>“Aren’t the stars grand tonight?” she cried, wrinkling her
smooth forehead a little, as though making a real and
quite taxing effort to appreciate God’s celestial accomplishment.
“Did you ever see ’em so big?”</p>

<p>Jerome never had.</p>

<p>“I just love to be out on the ocean,” she sighed, “but ain’t-it-awful-Mabel
to think where we’d go to if the boat <em>would</em>
go all the way over?”</p>

<p>The <i>Skipping Goone</i> plowed steadily along through a warm
sea under the stars.</p>

<p>“I’m crazy to get to Honolulu,” the girl observed.</p>

<p>So was Jerome.</p>

<p>“Have you ever been there?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I hear there’s a wonderful beach where it’s always moonlight,
and everybody plays on those things—”</p>

<p>“Ukuleles?”</p>

<p>“That’s it!”</p>

<p>“I used to have one.”</p>

<p>“You did? What a pity you didn’t bring it along—to
Girardin’s,” she added with a little humorous smile. “It
would sound sweet a night like this on the water, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p>He agreed. There was a warm silence. Then she began
singing, in a dreamy voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I want to be the leading lady,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I want to have the all-star part....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She yawned, in a pleasantly relaxed way, and snuggled.
“I hate to go to bed a night like this,” she sighed.</p>

<p>Jerome suggested daringly: “Let’s stay up all night!”</p>

<p>Then she tittered again and narrowed her eyes. But for
all her lightness, it was becoming obvious that Lili’s attitude
toward Jerome had altered somewhat since the day she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
gone around with the petition about tie clips. She still
beamed on him, of course, because Lili wouldn’t know how
to look at any man without more or less beaming. But
she also looked at him not a little seriously. He didn’t,
somehow, seem quite so funny to look at as he had at first,
and he didn’t talk so stiffly.</p>

<p>After a little she asked: “What are you going to do when
we get there?”</p>

<p>Jerome didn’t know.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any idea?”</p>

<p>He shrugged and lamented: “I’ve only got forty cents to
my name!”</p>

<p>She poised it with a faint but very friendly smile.</p>

<p>“I know one thing,” he declared stoutly. “I don’t like the
idea of going back—honest I don’t!”</p>

<p>“Then why do you go back?”</p>

<p>“What <em>can</em> I do?”</p>

<p>“If you could only sing, you might join us in the chorus!”</p>

<p>(Stella, it vaguely occurred to him, would have replied:
“Can’t you think of anything yourself?”)</p>

<p>“I wish I could sing,” he said.</p>

<p>“Ever try?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I sound like one of the fog horns on Yerba Buena
during a tule fog!”</p>

<p>She laughed. “It’s a pity, because you could stick around.”</p>

<p>“I’ve often thought I’d like to go on the stage if I ever
got a chance....”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you speak about it to Mr. Curry?”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’d take me on?”</p>

<p>“He’s awful good-hearted,” she evaded, adding: “Are you
sure it’s as bad as a fog horn?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I could learn how. Is it very hard to follow
those highbrow tunes?”</p>

<p>“N-no,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Do you think I ought not to go back?”</p>

<p>“I’m not much at handing out advice,” she replied, quite
seriously, the stars making her big eyes strangely bright, “but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
if I was you I’d certainly keep on going, now you got
started.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, a new determination in his voice. “I
guess you’re right. Great Scott! It certainly does seem
years since Girardin’s!”</p>

<span class="smaller">—AND ELSEWHERE</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Before port was reached two facts important to this
history had been established: the first that Jerome
was to join the troupe—not, indeed, as a member of
the chorus (since he had satisfactorily demonstrated to the impresario
that his allusion to fog horns had not been in exaggeration)
but instead as a clerical assistant to Mr. Curry;
and the second, that he had fallen madly in love with Lili.</p>

<p>The first fact was simple enough; as for the second, no
doubt the gods on far Olympus smiled a little. But love
spurns the orthodox, and after all heeds few conventions.</p>

<p>Of course everybody knew about it, for the <i>Skipping
Goone</i> was poor soil in which to cultivate secrets. So the
clerk’s love affair was discussed, just as any issue of general
public interest would be anywhere.</p>

<p>That a clerk should fall in love with a girl who sang on
the stage could not possibly cause any surprise, though
that Lili should likewise be smitten with the clerk might
seem a little less true to type. But somehow Lili wasn’t
quite a type. She rather baffled. Besides, she hadn’t exactly
fallen in love with Jerome the way he had fallen in love
with her. However, it was a most interesting case; Mr.
Curry’s songbirds found it so, and adapted themselves to its
oddities in the easy manner of men and women of the world.
It wasn’t, for that matter, the first time they had beheld
the alluring little singer with a beau.</p>

<p>Any one who had known Jerome intimately during the slow-moving
years in San Francisco would have been astonished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
enough upon encountering him in the flushed midst of this
new phase of his career. One of the first momentous changes
was an entire absence of the classic tie clip, which Lili, in
playful mood, had snatched off one day and flung far out to
sea. Thus, in a flash, one of the most eloquent emblems
of his whole former life vanished away. It was really
wonderful how much less obscure Jerome looked without the
clip. But that was only that. As for the rest—well, Lili’s
beaming eyes alone were a liberal education. And, though
she often enough shocked Jerome with brazenries for which
he wasn’t yet altogether prepared, and while she never seemed
to take anything quite so seriously as he did, her knowledge
of the great world opened his mind to somewhat wider
horizons (despite her occasional deficiencies in grammar and
manners) than he had even remotely glimpsed during the
epoch when he used sometimes to think of “cutting quite a
figure in the world some day.”</p>

<p>Well, he was cutting a figure now! No, he didn’t feel
altogether at home with himself any more. But it was
broadening not to—there was such a thing, he now began to
realize, as feeling too much at home.</p>

<p>Gradually his entire viewpoint changed, so that it was with
amazement he perceived how he had been satisfied just to
drudge along in San Francisco, with nothing ever happening.
He had definitely shaken the dust of the past off his shoes.
He was through with the old life forever.</p>

<p>A persisting lightness in Lili troubled him some. She had
what at first struck him as an unnecessarily vulgar way of
shouting to her friends: “I’ve got a man! I’ve got a man!”
And he could never, for instance, begin seriously talking about
the way he felt, and about the future but Lili would laugh it
all away with some perfectly frivolous, or at least irrelevant
remark. Her tolerance of the incessantly interrupting pleasantries
of the comedian was distinctly a bore. Jerome’s incorrigibly
healthy ego assured him something was wrong, and
that while the mock-respect of earlier days had largely worn
off, he still wasn’t treated with that degree of honest respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
which the majesty of his ambitious manhood demanded. Jerome
had buried his past with its mistakes and its follies and
humiliations, and he demanded of the world that it treat him
accordingly.</p>

<p>Sometimes the startling suddenness of everything would momentarily
overcome. And he didn’t know ... well, at any
rate, he mustn’t permit life to run away with him; to have life
run away with him might not be so bad as to have it crawl
away with him; but it would be bad enough. Sometimes when
Lili laughed he had a feeling that life <em>was</em> running away with
him. He had moments of feeling a trifle wobbly about life.
Only one thing seemed, through everything, perfectly clear:
it was too late now to think of turning back!</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Arrival at Honolulu was plentifully exciting. Naturally
every one was on deck. Captain Bearman set up a sort of preliminary
barking through his splendid whiskers.</p>

<p>Mr. Curry’s press agent, though not conspicuous for creative
ingenuity, had carried out with tolerable success most of
the “advance” ideas with which the impresario had eagerly
and patiently supplied him. There was a throng down to
welcome in the band of venturesome troupers. The newspapers
sent their most gifted reporters, and had reserved space
on their front pages for a generous human-interest yarn. A
native orchestra was strumming on the dock. Of course all
the songbirds were wild to debark.</p>

<p>Shore connections established, the reporters descended and
tongues were ardently loosed. Most of the songbirds had a
very efficiently developed sense of publicity. Miss Valentine,
the coloratura who could sing up to F, turned from one to
another, talking with elaborate elegance and conveying the
impression that she considered this a very great lark indeed—something
in the nature of a playful interlude between triumphs
of the past (a little yawn and much patting of curls)
and radiant contracts in the future. The comedian told funny
stories of life aboard the <i>Skipping Goone</i>, and agreeably noted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
out of a corner of his eye that some of them were being reduced
to hieroglyphics. One story they all seized upon was the
story of the clerk who had failed to wake up; and the clerk
must be found and interviewed, and somebody even snapped
his picture.</p>

<p>As for the impresario—of course he was made use of to the
fullest advantage. “Like a conquering monarch,” one of the
papers next day proclaimed his arrival; nor was this an exaggeration,
for Xenophon Curry in all his bright habiliments
did look like a conquering monarch, and carried himself like
one, too, so proud was he—oh, a very human sort of conquering
monarch: one with a smile such as, in the words of another
paper, “it would be worth walking all the way around Oahu to
see.”</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Preference might have carried Xenophon Curry out to the
Beach, but <i lang="la">ars longa; vita brevis</i>—he settled cheerfully at the
Alexander Young so as to be near the theatre.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he descended from his room when a most surprising
circumstance developed. Over in one corner of the
lobby stood a small booth where ladies of social prominence
were selling flowers for the benefit of a local charity. All at
once the impresario stopped and gazed, unbelieving, fascinated.
And at the very same moment there was a stir inside
the booth, and lo! one of the ladies came forth from it, came
smiling and nodding toward him across the lobby, her face
shining with welcome, and a ready hand outstretched.</p>

<p>Flora Utterbourne—yes, it was really she! Their greeting,
as may well be imagined, was effusive and faintly loud. It
was really beautiful!</p>

<p>“But—I left you on the dock...!” he faltered lamely,
but happily.</p>

<p>“I know,” she laughed, with warm joyousness, though without
his amazement, “but you see—I took the next steamer
<em>down</em>, for there were some <em>friends</em> who had been planning to
spend a few <em>weeks</em> here and asked me to go <em>along</em>, and I found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
I could get <em>away</em>, though I really hadn’t intended leaving town
just at this <em>time</em>!”</p>

<p>They chattered, then, delightedly, and for ever so long
couldn’t seem to exhaust the stock of superlative congratulations,
self and mutual. At last, however, they seated themselves,
and she went on flowingly: “It really was my <em>friends</em>”—just
a faintly blushing insistence—“who ‘carried me off’—the
Trents, originally of <em>Toronto</em>—perhaps you <em>know</em> them?—and
Mrs. Clyde, who was Miss <em>Spurling</em>,—she is the friend I was
with in <em>Madeira</em>, the year we met Signora Martinella, who
nearly ‘took her life’ in such a strange and tragic <em>way</em>!” And
Flora was enthusiastically launched, right then and there, upon
a most amazing digression, all about the Signora Martinella,
who was encountered first in the ball room—“rather <em>flirting</em>,
we thought—quite a <em>frivolous</em> little thing!” And then it developed—oh,
well, it was a very absorbing affair, and the
Signora in the end <em>didn’t</em> take poison. Oh yes, it was most
elaborately enthusiastic; and when the end was reached she and
the impresario sat facing each other in a state of breathlessness:
it was several seconds before they seemed to realize that
all this had no essential point for them! When at length they
did realize this, she smiled, a little self-consciously, while he
was humorously devouring her with his bright black eyes, and
trying to convince himself that this incredible fact really <em>was</em>
a fact.</p>

<p>“We’ve been scanning the ‘horizon’ with such <em>anxiety</em>,” she
told him, “hoping each day for a glimpse of the <em>schooner</em>—trusting
and praying that nothing had ‘gone wrong’, and in the
meantime we’ve been advertising your ‘songbirds’ really most
<em>extensively</em>, and are planning to attend the ‘first night’ of each
new <em>production</em>, which quite takes me back to the old days in
<em>Paris</em>, when I was doing a little studying <em>myself</em>, though of
course I knew I never had anything more than a ‘parlour’
voice, and only wanted to train it a little so that I could give
pleasure to my <em>friends</em>, in a way!” And then—it seemed so
irresistibly to fit in here—he was told all about the funny old
Italian teacher who would jump up and down, exclaiming:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
“<i lang="it">Troppo apperto!</i>” till she would ask in despair: “But what
can I <em>do</em> about it?” whereupon the Italian would cry:
“<i lang="it">Chiudi! Chiudi!</i>” Flora smiled richly over the reminiscence.</p>

<p>And then, as they proceeded, she was so very sympathetic
that the impresario just poured out, on the spot, all his business
and artistic troubles, and told her about the clerk—“Lord,
a sheer stroke of luck from my point of view!” And she
humorously sighed: “It’s <em>always</em> puzzled me how you’ve managed
to keep everything <em>going</em> in your own head!” And he
asked: “But you see how mysteriously life works? Isn’t it
really remarkable? You never know if people you just casually
meet may be destined....” It trailed off in the wake
of a gesture just a little wild; for obviously both had instantly
caught from this a personal not to say a most thrilling application.</p>

<p>Well, in a word, both of them rejoiced—like a couple of
youngsters—at being together again!</p>

<p>“I know you’ve a <em>thousand</em> things to <em>do</em>,” she said at last,
rising, “and I mustn’t keep you any longer, though I <em>couldn’t</em>
help ‘waylaying’ you the first <em>thing</em>! You see, I’m helping
some of my friends—we’re selling flowers for homeless
babies!” She laughed softly. “I really feel almost like a
‘native’, and you know—I’ve taken a <em>house</em>, and have it nearly
all <em>furnished</em>, though I’d intended merely to <em>rest</em> here in
Honolulu! I understand how <em>busy</em> you are, and that it won’t
be possible for you to ‘drop in’ quite so frequently as <em>before</em>,
though the little ‘villino’ by the sea will be always wide open
to <em>welcome</em> you, and I must show you my <em>charming</em> Japanese
‘breakfast’ dishes!”</p>

<p>“I think you’ll find I’ll manage,” he said, stroking his
toupee delightedly with a couple of deft, tender fingers. He
was perfectly radiant.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’ll give a little garden <em>tea</em> one day, for I’ve a
really most <em>delicious</em> terrace, and invite your ‘songbirds,’ and
maybe Miss Valentine would <em>sing</em>!” Whereupon the big impresario<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
almost whooped—yes, right there in the lobby—because
his temperamental heart was making such an enormous
commotion. And for that matter the lady’s heart was making
a commotion also.</p>

<p>“<i lang="it">Addio, signore!</i>” she murmured cordially—and was gone,
her skirts rustling very much.</p>

<p>Jerome made off as soon as he could—or rather as soon as
the intense delight of this new type of excitement permitted
him to think of it—and sent a cable to his family. Mr. Curry
paid him a month’s salary in advance, so that he wasn’t quite
penniless. Indeed, he felt himself rolling in riches. He
supplied himself with a small trunk and considerable necessary
apparel. In a shop window where he saw them displayed
Jerome hesitated over the necessity of a new clip; but he
astutely argued that since Lili had snatched off his old clip
and flung it to sea, evidently there was something about clips—or
at any rate as associated with himself—which made sophisticated
people laugh; the temptation was stoutly resisted. He
purchased a haircut, too, which helped enormously; and went
about smoking his short-stemmed pipe—not exactly jauntily,
as in the old days when he thought he knew so much and really
knew so little, but rather in a resolute, sober manner, which
seemed proclaiming at least one highly important milestone
passed.</p>

<p>Everybody was furiously busy, getting settled and trying to
see the sights and do the required rehearsing and necessary
shopping all at the same time. As for the sight-seeing, that
could no doubt have waited; but in the case of most of Mr.
Curry’s songbirds, temperament dictated otherwise. And it
frequently happened, during the first days in Honolulu, that
members of the troupe would bow to each other, sometimes a
shade haughtily but usually with whole-hearted zest, from
carriages in which they were being driven everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>Jerome and Lili did a little sight-seeing together, though
(being not, as one has already seen, quite a type) she very
sensibly wouldn’t hear of his hiring a carriage, but insisted
that “Gawd knows I’m not too elegant to ride on a street car
<em>yet</em>!”</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Hagen’s island—a tiny realm of wonder and suspense....
There it lay, lost in a warm and dreaming
sea, a blue on all sides of uncompromising intensity.
Yes, the island, saturated with sunshine, often richly
agleam with pearls from a swift, brief downpour of rain,
appeals to the eye as not quite real, with its murmurs of palm
and giant fern, its ruined docks, its broken derrick once
painted red and standing now against the lush bloom like a
spectre ruling in an empire of everlasting silence. “Quite capable
once—h’m?—of bringing on a war somewhere”—yet
now such a spot of smiling, dreaming quiet. (“Oh, the
laughter behind it all....”)</p>

<p>Except when tempest sweeps, furious and black, across the
world, whipping the sea into a churning fury and tearing
through the close fabric of the jungle like an offended offspring
of Cerberus, the island sleeps and broods under a sky
tenderly blue and lofty; while restless along the comb of the
inner reefs is ever a rustling fringe of white, “a necklace with
conscience of lead....” There is foam on the lap of the
yellow beach. A place—yes, a place not unhaunted, and
bringing sometimes, by the sheer charm of its drowsy hush, a
little throb to the throat. And silence—so white and enthralling,
whether at noon or lighted by luminous spheres of
southern midnight: a silence such as one may encounter in
some little lonely church among the hills of Italy....</p>

<p>But all suddenly, within a house cleverly constructed of
palm trunks, the silence was broken; a woman stood tacking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
something against the wall. A man in riding breeches, pongee
coat, and white shirt open at the throat, was just in the act of
draining a little glass of amber coloured liquor in an adjoining
room. He sang out to her:</p>

<p>“Stella! What are you up to? You sound like a whole
army of carpenters!”</p>

<p>She laughed with an effect of coyness and stepped back.
“You’d never guess, Ferd!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“No, you’ll have to come in and see.”</p>

<p>He came, his handsome face a little more flushed than usual,
perhaps, and his eyes supremely blue and round.</p>

<p>“Aha!” he exclaimed in the doorway of the room they
humorously called their parlour.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know anything about it,” laughed the girl, “till
I came across it at the very bottom of the trunk. I certainly
would never have thought of bringing a calendar! Maud must
have slipped it in—she was always raving about that picture—isn’t
it beautiful?” Stella laughed derisively, though without
bitterness, for the past was all behind her. “It used to hang
in the dining room,” she explained. “I guess Maud thought
it might look cheerful to us a long way from home. It gives
you a sort of feeling of being still in touch with the world,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It does,” he agreed, and, with a faint smile, beheld a large
mercantile calendar, a bright-coloured print filling the upper
half. The picture showed a sailor just returned to his little
home nest after hazardous voyages. All the colours were too
gaudy, and the sailor’s dog was absurdly foreshortened; but
it was a joyous tableau, within its frame of coiled and knotted
ropes; and across the hearthrug, in energetic gold, one read:</p>

<p class="center">Oaks, Ferguson &amp; Whitley,<br />
Ships’ Chandlers</p>

<p>The soft, scented breath of the jungle outside crooned a
little through the rustle of palm and fern fronds, just now and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
then audible; and it stirred the mats at the windows and sometimes
made the doors creak hauntingly on their jungle-vine
hinges.</p>

<p>“What’s today?” asked King, lighting a cigarette. And he
added, with a faint note of restlessness behind the laugh:
“Already it’s beginning not to matter much!”</p>

<p>Stella glanced at the calendar gayly. “Today is Thursday—the
fourteenth.” Then, clasping her hands with some excitement,
she exclaimed: “Why, isn’t that St. Valentine’s Day?”</p>

<p>“By Jove, you’re right, Stella.”</p>

<p>She seemed quite delighted over the discovery, though it was
with a trace of seriousness she mused: “<em>Doesn’t</em> it seem strange
to think of Valentine’s Day with nobody but ourselves within
hundreds of miles who ever heard of St. Valentine?”</p>

<p>She glanced around her at the primitive surroundings. A
great, lustrous butterfly with heavy wings alighted on one of
the sills and drooped there, poised.</p>

<p>King looked at his wife with half quizzical amusement.
“Can’t we celebrate some way, even so?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—let’s!” she cried, eager to make the most of an
unexpected fête day.</p>

<p>“I simply must step around to the florist’s and order you
some orchids. Shall I, little girl?”</p>

<p>“Please do!” she laughed. “I’m sure you’ll find orchids
in abundance just now—and so cheap! Really yours for the
picking!”</p>

<p>“You must admit,” he reminded her, “that living in a jungle
possesses some advantages.”</p>

<p>“Yes, even if not quite all the comforts of home!”</p>

<p>She liked these little flashes of “repartee,” for they always
carried her back to the wonderful night at the ball; yet in the
midst of it, oddly enough, she remembered the frilled paper-lace
valentine Jerome had sent her a year ago. She had found
it, thick with cupids, tied to the doorknob; and it had proved
really the beginning of their dull little courtship. “Poor
Jerome,” she thought, “would have to do the conventional
thing. Such magnificence as orchids....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>King held out his arms romantically, and she ran to him.
His look was at once dazzling and tender.</p>

<p>“Give me a kiss, little girl!”</p>

<p>She raised her face happily.</p>

<p>“Now another.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ferd—I never dreamed of being so happy!”</p>

<p>“Let me steal one on the tip of your nose,” he requested.
“There!”</p>

<p>She laughed softly, and he asked: “How much do you love
me, lady-bird?”</p>

<p>Could any one doubt he had fallen in love with her as
he might fall in love with Irmengarde?</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Three days since Captain Utterbourne had lifted his hat to
them on the doorstep of their new abode—lifted it almost formally,
his lips just flickering to a smile of such supreme
opaqueness that no one could possibly divine anything that
happened to be behind it in the way of emotion. Then the
<i>Star of Troy</i> had slipped off, quietly and swiftly.</p>

<p>They had gone down and stood together on the ruined dock
and watched her through the binoculars Captain Utterbourne
had given them for a wedding gift; watched till she sank beneath
the rim of a cloudless horizon; watched even the thin
plume of smoke till the blue of the blazing tropical sky had
sucked it into eternal limbo. It was then, really for the first
time, they had become aware of the almost unearthly stillness....</p>

<p>But how fair it was—what breathless beauty! Stella had
never imagined a spot so rich in sheer natural loveliness.
She rambled in moods of romantic bewilderment; wandered
along avenues of lush abundance; heard the soft thud of
cocoanuts, and sipped their icy milk with delight. All was
so strange and utterly new to her; so wonderful. It was like
a dream from which one <em>must</em> waken.... Sometimes it was
very subtly like music one cannot listen to without mysterious
tremors beyond the realm of words. The air was warm and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
a little heavy with the spice of moist luxuriance, and dead-ripe
fruit tinted with sunshine. One’s spirit drowsed; merely
to breathe was exquisite. Stella roamed in a cloud of wonder,
sometimes almost of awe.... And she thought: what a setting
for the romance that had so suddenly bloomed in her drab
life!</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>King stood on a gentle rise of rich turf, gazing off through
the binoculars across cultivated fields. Presently up toward
him through a shining little valley rode a Japanese on one of
the Australian ponies Utterbourne had imported. King lowered
his glass and watched, a smile half of amusement on his
face. It was Tsuda—an amazing creature of prowess and
contradictions. The Captain had plucked him out of a brawl
over a geisha girl up in Yezo—“Fancy—h’m?”—to begin
with. And after that—oh, but the Captain possessed faculties
unfathomable for picking his men. According to Tsuda, the
Captain had saved his life—indeed, Tsuda was very dogmatic
about it.</p>

<p>“Ho, there!” King called out, as the Japanese, having
dismounted in the shade of a thicket of dwarf palms, trotted
up the incline to the spot where the new overseer stood.
“Don’t begin any salaaming or kowtowing, Tsuda,” he begged
him with a laugh. “I’ve been salaamed to death all
morning. What have you done to those poor devils of Ainu?”</p>

<p>Tsuda stood beside him, very little and humble. He
wheezed some. “Taught the fear of the gods,” he replied.
“Yes, <em>sir</em>!”</p>

<p>King hooted. “You’ll finish me, Tsuda, with your priest-ideas
and your fairy tales. I never heard such a bunch of
outlandish nonsense in my life! But of course we’ve got to
hand the method credit, I suppose, since it keeps us supplied
with free labour.”</p>

<p>Tsuda bowed solemnly. “It is—gn—the way of the gods,”
he murmured. And then, making sure they were quite
alone, he edged a step nearer, assumed a less formal bearing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
and added, in a voice which had startlingly acquired a
note of the utmost sophistication: “If that fail—gn—there is
always the saké!” And he chuckled like an incorrigible
urchin up to tricks.</p>

<p>Tsuda’s English was quite remarkable. It was rather a
mystery where he’d managed to pick it all up, packed, as it
was, with slyly winking colloquialisms, even occasional
wisps of slang. Tsuda was a genuine man of the world, in
his own odd way. Very up-to-date, very devious, subtly
sophisticated—a very waggish person, too; though he could
upset it all in a minute with revelations of a most utter and
child-like simplicity. As for the curious “gn” which now
and then punctuated his talk, that mystified rather, till
one came to detect about it the humble earmarks of asthma.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Priest,” said King, who had raised his
binoculars again, “there’s a queer something or other going
on—come here and look through the glasses. It’s one of
your Ainu women, and she seems to be burying something—I
can’t make out what.”</p>

<p>Tsuda handled the binoculars proudly but awkwardly.
“Oh, that’s a woman who don’t want her husband any
more,” he shrugged casually. “Want him to die—yes, <em>sir</em>!
So she make his head-dress like a corpse. Dig a hole for it—gn.
You see how she bob her head up and down? She
pray that he rot with the head-dress.”</p>

<p>King exclaimed in amazement: “What piece of crazy
superstition do you call this?” The island lay still and
glowing round about them. The sky was without a cloud, the
sea without a sail.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask <em>me</em>!” shrugged Tsuda waggishly. “Don’t
blame me for any of these damn kind of thing! You see
such go on all the time. No telling—gn—what a lot of damn
heathen ideas I’ve had to put out of their heads! By golly
tried to tell me once the earth rest on the back of a fish, and
when he wiggle that make earthquakes! But they’re toned
down a whole lot since then. It was a time in Paromushir
you see an Ainu woman give suck to a bear cub. But no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
more. No sir!” He shook his head a little sadly. “These
fellows haven’t got the pep they used to have—not by a
God-damn! All mixed up with Russian and Japanese. No
good—no good.” He looked really mournful over the undoubted
decay of this lost tribe on which he had lavished
his affection so many years.</p>

<p>Tsuda had succeeded, when the Imperial summons came
from Tōkyō ordering all the Kurile Ainu down to a convenient
pen at Shikotan, in concealing a whole tribe up in the remote
mountains of Paromushir, becoming himself a sort
of perpetual king over them. It was wild and daring—yes,
a work of genius, clearly, though Tsuda’s affection was never
without its ulterior motive. There had been a lucrative
business in salmon, which by this novel method he acquired
gratis. And then—Utterbourne.</p>

<p>Yes, Utterbourne had come along with Hagen’s Island fresh
in mind, and the problem of cheap labour as yet unsolved,
he had plucked Tsuda out of the brawl in Yezo; had looked
at him with eyes half closed, in his quizzical poising way;
had hinted discreetly about gold, much gold. A few months
later Tsuda led his Ainu tribe down out of the mountains
and into the hold of the <i>Star of Troy</i>, whose prow was turned
toward the dreamy south.</p>

<p>Hagen’s Island—a fugitive, lost tribe: what an inspiration
to bring them together! In truth, it had been one of the
Captain’s very finest flashes.</p>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Sometimes the glowing mystery of her new island
home seemed to rush upon Stella and make her a
little faint.</p>

<p>“Ferd, dear,” she said breathlessly, “who would ever have
dreamed of our coming to a place like this?”</p>

<p>He eyed her searchingly.</p>

<p>“So strange, Ferd—isn’t it? So almost unbelievable!”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he mused, “if you would have come if you’d
known what it was going to be like?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” she laughed softly. “It’s so beautiful I almost
want to cry sometimes. And the silence.... Oh,” she
exclaimed, “I tried so hard to imagine what our life was
going to be like, but I never guessed a place like this!”
Her smile was quiet and engaging. “At first,” she went
on, “I felt almost sure, from things you said, it was going
to be some big city in Europe or the East....”</p>

<p>They strolled together off to the rocky shore and stood
gazing a long time across the tender resting sea. Silence!
The sun was dropping beyond the sheen of a little crescent
beach, with the jungle climbing rich and dark, unstirred save
by the echo of such voices as are never still, by day or night.
Slowly the sky grew splendid. Clouds drifted and piled,
painted with crimson and flushed with living gold.</p>

<p>Stella sat by her husband in a rapture of romantic happiness.
Far down against the face of a rock gently slapped
by the waxing tide, ran an odd white fissure, and crabs were
busy scuttling all about it. The air was faintly scented with
brine and seaweed as evening began to close in.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ferd....” she faltered delightedly. “It’s <em>so</em> still!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>And then, as the dark came on, she drew her husband into
one of his moods of verbal grandeur, and sat entranced
beside him while he multiplied, so easily, the splendours in
store for them. This was but a beginning. They were to
climb—the future was full of light.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d like it if I got a consular place in Cairo,
later on?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!”</p>

<p>“Or—or an ambassador’s in Rome...?”</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>King and Tsuda stood together under some date palms at
the edge of a field—a mass of vivid green—white blossoms
tossing in the tropical breeze—petals here and there
whirling and floating idly. The field was aswarm with
bare-legged Ainu labourers in short, rough tunics. They bent
dully to their task, an expression of unbroken hopelessness
on their sad, hairy faces. “A little experiment in transplanting—h’m?”
the Captain called it. When King passed
any of the Ainu they would suspend their work and
clumsily prostrate themselves. All the men had long hair
and prodigious moustaches drooping despondently down
amongst the vegetation with which their hands were busy.
There were women of the tribe, too, with faces for the most
part hideously tattooed, and wearing on their heads bright
coloured handkerchiefs of Russian manufacture, which gave
them a picturesque, peasant-like appearance.</p>

<p>Tsuda was saying: “This year much rain—look damn good—like
a bumper crop—yes, <em>sir</em>! Up to Bihar and Bengal,
maybe—gn—even Afghanistan. I was all over those places,”
he added, in an important, off-hand tone, “learning the business
right on the ground—yes, sir!” His eyes darted rapidly
about, met the new overseer’s gaze, then flitted off.</p>

<p>“What’s the exact acreage?” asked King quietly. Tsuda
looked a bit blank. “Any way of estimating what a normal
crop ought to be?” And without giving the other opportunity
to reply, he added, rather crisply: “We’re going to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
little more scientific, from now on, even if you did have unusual
advantages over in India and thereabouts.”</p>

<p>Tsuda flashed at him a glance, then looked glum. His eyes
were restless. His lips moved, but what he brought out was
merely a nonplussed “gn.”</p>

<p>“What was last year’s export?” demanded King.</p>

<p>“About five hundred chest.” For the moment Tsuda’s
usual blitheness appeared damped, and his was the bearing of
a man squirming faintly under an incipient sense of infringement.</p>

<p>King reached idly down and pulled off one of the blossoms
with its nearly ripe capsule, turned it round and round, eyed
it curiously, sniffed it. It had a strange, pungent odour.
He crushed it, and his fingers were stained with a warm
pinkish fluid.</p>

<p>Tsuda watched him, his eyes showing a glitter of suppressed
excitement. “Ever try any of it yourself?” he asked,
his voice nervous and oddly shrill.</p>

<p>“No, I never did,” laughed King. “What’s it like, Tsuda?”</p>

<p>“Say,” the other replied, in an offended yet subtly smirking
way, “do you take me—gn—for a fellow with inside information?”</p>

<p>King laughed again, this time rather dryly. “I guess
you’ve given it a trial, at least—just now and then, perhaps?”</p>

<p>Slowly, and at first as though grudgingly, Tsuda smiled.
The smile spread into a very clever, confidential grin. “You
needn’t please mention it to the Captain,” he muttered, “but
this is a damn-God-forsaken hole.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” replied King, his tone slightly labelled.</p>

<p>“Sss!” Tsuda acknowledged. And then, after a brief
pause which, on his side, was obviously not a little breathless,
he pursued: “Maybe you feel that way too, later on—later
on—gn—and want to give it a try—yes, <em>sir</em>!”</p>

<p>King fairly howled with mirth. Tsuda was a trifle transparent,
after all. But tough. Oh, he was a tough old bird!
He was anxious to share his iniquities....</p>

<p>“I have an extra spirit lamp,” Tsuda murmured meekly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
in a very small voice, his eyes humbly on the turf, “and—gn—some
pipes I smuggled in,” he half giggled. “It’s a
damn lonely hole here—you shall see. The people here
before were lucky to clear out—yes, <em>sir</em>! The coal people
and that albatross-dutchman business—all rot,” he grinned
parenthetically.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve been here long enough to know by this
time,” suggested King.</p>

<p>Tsuda came quite close and muttered, his bony hands restless
and his eyes mere darting slits: “You got to cut loose
sometimes—simply have to! And,” he ended cryptically,
“<em>there’s only one way</em>!”</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">It was before dawn—a dark and heavy hour, with the stars
just dimming and a light wind in the jungle. Stella was
asleep, dreaming: she seemed to be out on the rocks
of the shore, where she and Ferdinand had sat enriching
the sunset with their wonderful projections. She saw it all
in her dream so vividly: the rocky promontory, the sunny
sea beyond, and had a sense, as one does in dreams, of something
about to happen. The white beach below shimmered
in the glare of a vacant sky. In her dream she felt the
strange spell of the silence, made manifold. It held her
breathless and she waited, full of wonder. Presently as she
gazed across the slumbering sea, a great ship came into view—was
it this for which the breath of premonition had prepared
her? She gazed, and the ship seemed coming straight
on, like an enchanted ship. Her heart stirred with delight.</p>

<p>Abruptly, however, Stella awoke, with a sharp pang of
fear and sat up in bed, trembling. Something like a wild
cry seemed to have broken her dream. She heard it again,
though fainter through the woven fastness of the jungle:
the cry of some great night bird, a note so sinister and full
of lamentation that her brow grew a little damp with the
terror of her rousing. Yet in a moment she was calm.</p>

<p>Her husband lay beside her, quietly sleeping. She listened
to his regular breathing in the dark, then lay down and
closed her eyes. Gradually the silence drew her back into
a state of drowsiness. She slept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>When she woke again the dark was gone and the sun stood
high.</p>

<p class="tb">Slipping from bed and into an adjoining room of her
strange new dwelling, Stella lighted a small oil stove and
started a kettle of water for their coffee. Returned to the
bedroom, she arrayed herself in a bit of frilled and beribboned
negligée and a lacy boudoir cap: small extravagancies
of the unambitious shopping tours preceding her
wedding. Adorned in these luxuries, she sat before her
improvised dressing table to begin a rather elaborate
toilette.</p>

<p>Stella had done all she could with the primitive conditions
surrounding her here. The dressing table was fashioned
out of an empty packing case, covered with some old flowered
goods. A small mirror hung above it, and on either side
were cheap little bracket candle-holders with coloured candles
that had begun to nod under the hot breath of the tropics.
She had pictured herself in a boudoir rather more authentic;
but for the present this one would do very well.</p>

<p>She sat absorbed in the pleasant task of making herself
attractive. Ferdinand still slept, but was beginning to stir.
Even in bed, relaxed and disheveled with sleep, he looked like
a god; and Stella, glancing over at him, felt more than ever
inspired to make herself beautiful. She must hold his love,
she mused—and even tinted her cheeks a little.</p>

<p>King yawned and turned. A romantic manœuvre entered
her head, almost as though inspired by the gay little cap. She
fluttered over to the bed. “I’ll wake him with a kiss!” she
thought. However, the stratagem was not productive of entirely
happy results. Her husband hoisted himself on an elbow
and blinked a moment at the surprising apparition he had
married; but instead of compensating her in some way for this
early effort in his behalf, King let his eyes droop shut again,
with a tiny frown, and slipped back—he had barely seen her.
The unfortunate bride had violated an entrenched masculine
tradition: these things are very subtle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>Yet sleep was really exhausted, after all, and a moment later
King thought better of his drowsy petulance, roused and called
to her: “Stella!” And she paused, turning a little toward him,
while he blinked goodhumouredly and held out an arm, beckoning
slowly. She gave him a rueful smile and trudged back,
pouting a reluctant forgiveness, her heart relieved, though
still in a mood of vague disappointment.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t let little things upset you so easily, Stella,”
he said, with the faintest shade of curtness. “I’ve got a big
contract on my hands here, and must get my sleep out. Anyway,”
he added, patting her hand, “it isn’t late, is it?”</p>

<p>Stella glanced at her watch, pinned on amongst a gay
little whirl of ribbons and laces. “Nearly nine o’clock,”
she said—and, oddly enough, the intelligence quite changed
the complexion of things.</p>

<p>He sprang out of bed with an exclamation. “That’s what
a climate can do! Why didn’t you call me hours ago? I’ll
have to get an earlier start—where the devil is my shaving mug—is
there any hot water, Stella?”</p>

<p>“A little, Ferd,” she hesitated. “For our coffee....”</p>

<p>“Bring me what there is,” he requested bluntly. And asked
her where she kept his shirts.</p>

<p>“Ferd,”—she faltered a little. “You’re so brusque this
morning.... Don’t you—” and she indicated her finery
with a hesitating gesture. “I bought it because you said
this is your favourite colour....”</p>

<p>He paused in the energetic process of dressing and looked
at her squarely, yet at the same time without full attention.
“Yes, I do like it. It’s a dream.” And, since she still
hesitated, evidently perplexed and a little confounded, King
laughed with affectionate loudness and said: “Come here,
lady-bird, and I’ll make a fuss over you. I wasn’t thinking.
Of course you look good enough to eat! Give me a kiss.”</p>

<p>He gathered her up and hugged her.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>When her husband had gone, looking very handsome and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
magnetic in his white clothes and a stiff tropical hat, Stella
sat a little time at the doorstep, musing, letting her mind drift
on an undercurrent of vague debate. She idly watched some
dusky southern moths floating about a patch of dull orange
fungus in the brooding dimness of the jungle. Her thoughts,
unformed and roaming, were faintly sombre. She remembered
her haunting dream, so sharply broken by the cry of
the bird, and seemed again to see the ship sailing in toward
her; she wondered whether any ships did ever pass within range
of the island. Presently, with a little sigh, she got up and went
into the house. She took off her finery and laid it away,
putting on in its stead one of the sturdy house dresses Maud
had made up on the same pattern she used herself.</p>

<p>At first, as her hands were thrust into that familiar and
essentially unromantic element known in everyday parlance
as dish water, Stella mused with another thoughtful sigh:
“Here I am again...!” Yet in the very act of hurrying
through all such drudgery to have it out of the way, she
realized that when the housework was finished there would be
absolutely nothing to do until it was time to prepare luncheon.
Her life seemed suddenly so packed with hours, so freighted
with brooding silence.... “I must make a point of using
all the dishes I can at every meal,” she laughed softly.
The stillness, rendered poignant by the droning of wild bees
and a dainty ambient rustle of fern, pressed against her heart.</p>

<p>This morning she was unusually thorough. Capable Maud,
with memories of past shirking, would open her eyes indeed
could she look in at this marvel of housewifery. The dishes
out of the way, Stella turned quite happily to her sweeping,
singing a little as she worked. The broom had been one of
Captain Utterbourne’s poetic foresights....</p>

<p>Her task was broken in upon by a faint and very deferential
tap. She opened the door and on the threshold beheld
Tsuda, standing in a humble posture, hat in hand, and murmuring:
“Good morning.” He bowed low as he spoke, and
subtly shook his head a little, as though to emphasize his
acute humility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>She regarded him with a gleam of interested amusement.
Tsuda’s face, as he slowly raised it to the girl in the doorway,
showed itself ancient, yet with strangely youthful eyes; an
unusually long face, with a baffling, complex expression.
His loosely woven straw hat with its band of bright blue
ribbon, gave him a note of gaiety and youth. He looked
subtle and cool and debonair, despite his humility, as he stood
outside gazing up into the face of the only white woman
within rather a good many degrees of longitude and latitude.</p>

<p>“Mr. King isn’t here,” she told him, her eyes still amused.
There were times when Tsuda’s face looked just a little like
the face of a horse—though she had caught flashes of darker
qualities which left her, too, a trifle insecure. “I believe
my husband rode over to look at some fields on the other side
of the island.”</p>

<p>“Sss—I know,” Tsuda nodded rapidly. Then an expression
of quaint solicitude came into his bright young-looking eyes,
and he asked: “You find everything—gn—all right here?”</p>

<p>His mood this morning was par excellence the mood of a
child, naïve and trusting and simple as sunshine; and a few
moments later he was sitting cross-legged on the floor of
Mrs. King’s “parlour,” giving her a round-eyed account of
the manner in which he and all these dusky children of the
northland had been brought down out of far wild Paromushir
to take possession of an island nobody seemed to want.</p>

<p>“We come from the—gn—way up top of the Kurile Isles—very
high—you have not been there?” And he gazed
searchingly, as though he would glean from her face how
much they had shared with her—the masters, King and
Utterbourne.</p>

<p>“No,” said Stella, “I’ve never been there. I haven’t
travelled a great deal—until now,” she added with a gay little
laugh.</p>

<p>Tsuda hissed gently. “I want you to see how it was, please.
We come many moons ago in a great whale that burn inside
like a volcano!” His whole bearing was that of a child,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
wide-eyed with the sheer wonder of miracles befallen. “Yes
<em>sir</em>—a whale!”</p>

<p>Stella was plainly enthralled. The rewards of her romantic
patience and doll-like trust hadn’t been any too ample—“a
woman’s fingers don’t belong in a man’s work, little lady.”
King had displayed a laughing parsimony; and though
Captain Utterbourne, during the long voyage, must have
emitted at least a hundred thousand words of pure narrative,
interspersed with little gems of psychology and sociology and
ethics, he hadn’t taken the trouble to give out more than the
vaguest hints as to what lay before them in the throbbing
mystery of that future always just ahead over the bow of the
<i>Star of Troy</i>. Her curiosity about all this business of the
island was keenly aroused, and she was glad to listen to the
strange little Asiatic, who seemed indeed quite bursting with
friendly communicativeness.</p>

<p>Tsuda blinked rapidly. “My people had got bad, very
bad, about their altars. It was simply awful! No good to
forget your altars—bad, very bad.” He shook his long head
seriously. “Evil come then. There are ogres left—all
written down in great Book of Shintō—the way of the
gods....” His face seemed illuminated with almost a supernatural
glow. “Very bad, very bad! They come down
swoop in the night....” Tsuda nodded slowly and solemnly.
“But the gods send us some one to the rescue. He
look at you—gn—and you can’t look back....” Perhaps
Utterbourne had never received a finer tribute.</p>

<p>Tsuda leaned toward the girl, swaying in a mystic rhythm
as he talked, his voice high and a little tremulous; and as she
watched him and listened to his wild tale, told always in
that manner of open-eyed wonder, Stella vividly sensed the
contrast between this new life of hers and the old. “Where
<em>am</em> I?” she asked herself, laughing faintly, yet with a tiny
shiver too, almost of swift fear.</p>

<p>“He bring us all down here,” Tsuda continued. “The
whale is very dark, and give out long trail of black like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
volcano. He tell us we build altars and one day a new god—one
day the White Kami will come....” Tsuda broke off
abruptly, and asked in a voice which seemed to have taken
on a subtly darker and narrower quality: “You have not
seen the temple?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Stella.</p>

<p>“Good—I’ll show you—gn. Done in the finest Shintō....
I have a brother, once; he is priest in the Shinshū mountains.
I would be too, a priest, only—” Again he broke off, and
for a moment his eyes showed a fierce gleam of reminiscent
hate. But it passed, and he said very gently: “Will you come
and see?”</p>

<p>“The temple?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes—to goddess Amaterasu”—he half chanted the name.
“Mean the Heaven-shiner, goddess of the Sun—Shimmei,
sometimes, Ten Shōkō Daijin, Daijingū—we say—gn—Amaterasu.
You will come?”</p>

<p>“Is it far?” Stella asked him.</p>

<p>“No, no—not far.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she hesitated. Her breathing was a trifle accelerated.
It all seemed unbelievable....</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>There was a light truly of heaven in his eluding Asiatic
eyes. He led her to a little temple in a grove of palm and
giant fern; pointed out its mystic excellencies; talked a great
deal about Shintō which she couldn’t grasp.</p>

<p>“It’s like a little doll’s house!” she cried. “And so perfect!
I’m sure it must have taken you a long, long time to
build.” There were low mounds all about, for it was here,
also, that the dead were buried.</p>

<p>Tsuda seemed too vividly moved by the ecstasy, which
shone out of his eyes, to hear her little burst of amazed enthusiasm.
“Some day he tell us the White Kami will come.
We wait, long time. A very long time, it seem. One day”—Tsuda
crept closer—“the White Kami!” He lifted his arms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
in weird triumph. “The White Kami at last is come to live
among his children!”</p>

<p>Stella seemed to grasp in a flash the significance of this.
She thrust her hand, in a startled gesture, against one cheek;
found it burning.</p>

<p>Tsuda’s face, as he watched her so eagerly for news of the
emotions in her heart, suddenly clouded with shrewdness.
“They do not tell you?” he murmured, close; she could feel
his breath.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard nothing about this, Tsuda. You mean my
husband—?”</p>

<p>“Sss.” His eyes, so young in a face so lined and ancient,
never relaxed their eager searching look. “Tsuda tell you
all things,” he said softly and very humbly.</p>

<p>“The White Kami ...” she faltered, groping, her mind
in great confusion. For a moment it was almost as though
his words brought to her the discovery that she had married a
being of another species than herself.... The sensation,
though fleeting, was vivid and even terrible. And half consciously
she remembered how she had sat waiting in the
drawing room at Berkeley, and had felt, beyond the incommunicative
conventionality, of the place, a subtle sense of
something ominous....</p>

<p>Tsuda’s hands, lean and brown, moved restlessly. “The
Captain tell us,” he murmured, “we may look for the White
Kami. But he do not tell us you come too, Wife-of-the-Kami!”</p>

<p>When she looked at him his head was lowered; and as
though swayed by a religious impulse too powerful to be
denied, the Japanese slowly sank down onto one knee before
her and reverently brought the hem of her dress to his lips.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Jerome gradually learned the ways of the formidable box
office, and took charge of the General Ledger. Thus his
time was abundantly filled: during the day hustling
around with brokers in the interest of cargo shipments, and
at night helping check up with the house manager. As a
matter of fact, the company treasurer, whose real and legitimate
profession was selling life insurance, had been approached
with an attractive offer by a local insurance branch
and at the end of the present engagement the main brunt
of the financial responsibility would rest with Jerome—a
rather vaster contract than the stool-pigeon job at Oaks,
Ferguson &amp; Whitley’s.</p>

<p>He found being connected with a theatre very delightful—the
contacts, the excitement, the sense of privilege he felt
early in the evening standing out in the lobby between a glaring
poster that announced the night’s attraction and a huge
frame within which were arranged the pictures of all the
principal songbirds. He would watch the people stream in,
then would himself slip inside until the curtain had gone up,
after which he would go behind and absorb more and more
of the mysterious atmosphere which the audience was denied.
Here he could chat in the wings with his new friends, and
hold long, important tête-à-têtes with Lili during periods
of idleness when she wasn’t “on.”</p>

<p>The first popular-priced Saturday night, with the <cite>Bohemian
Girl</cite> in progress, these two young persons might have been discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
leaning up against a fragment of some palace or other,
engaged in a more than usually earnest conversation.</p>

<p>“Don’t get so excited, old dear,” cautioned the girl, beaming
upon him at the same time, however, and letting her eyes
slowly open wider and wider.</p>

<p>“But why <em>won’t</em> you marry me?” he persisted. It was the
old, old urge—and seemed, indeed, about the only aspect of
his former self that hadn’t been outgrown.</p>

<p>“Hear him rave!” she giggled. “You don’t seem to realize,
Jerry, what it means to get married!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” he replied in an indefinite but lofty
tone.</p>

<p>“Come on,” she coaxed, “let’s both be sensible. Aren’t we
all right as we are?”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?” he pressed on doggedly. “You admit
you love me. Isn’t that enough?”</p>

<p>She looked at him in her simple yet unfathomable way,
her smooth brow, so seldom fretted, showing faint furrows of
honest perplexity, as upon the night her challenged little soul
strove to appreciate the wonder of the lighted sky. And she
said: “This is a time when I wish I had some one to tell me
what to do!” It was a little mysterious, indeed, though her
eyes twinkled just perceptibly.</p>

<p>He gazed at her. “I’m telling you what to do, Lili!”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” she smiled. “I mean some
one....” It trailed off. On the stage a barytone was beginning
that famous soliloquy, the <cite>Heart Bowed Down</cite>. Lili
looked all at once a bit weary. She sighed and slumped
against the scenery, resting her cheek on a convenient brace.</p>

<p>“Listen, Jerry,” she coaxed, half dreamily, “I love you an
awful lot. You’re a nice boy. But let’s don’t talk about
getting married—please let’s don’t.”</p>

<p>“If you love me,” he insisted, “there’s no reason why we
shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>She shook her head, yet in a vaguely undecided way which
encouraged him to press his point. “I don’t see how it can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
be money that’s holding you back. Two can live cheaper
than one—everybody says so who’s tried it.”</p>

<p>“You mean two can live together cheaper than single, don’t
you?” she laughed.</p>

<p>“You know it’s true!” he cried. “And if it’s only because
you don’t want to give up hopes of being a prima donna,
why you don’t have to. You’d still have your job, and I’d
have mine.”</p>

<p>“But just supposing,” she rambled perversely, “I’d want
to leave the stage some day and have swell things and an
auto? What then, mister?”</p>

<p>“By that time,” he assured her, “I’ll be making enough
for two myself. I hope you don’t think I’m never going to
do anything bigger than this!” He spoke magnificently.</p>

<p>“Rich man, poor man,”—the girl gently enumerated the
buttons down the front of his coat, holding her head playfully
first on one side and then on the other.</p>

<p>“I’m crazy about you, Lili!” he said, somewhat thickly,
grasping her hands but not otherwise knowing exactly what
to do with such very strong emotion as this.</p>

<p>“I’m crazy about you too, Jerry,” she giggled. “They all
laugh at us for a couple of love-sick prunes, but that don’t
bother me. When I’m crazy about a man I’m <em>going</em> to be,
that’s all. Don’t you love the way he holds onto that last note?
Yes, I knew he’d get a hand! It always gets a hand when
you hold on that way.” And she sighed. “I wish I could
ever draw a real song like that. Do you think I’m satisfied
with the bits I do? I <em>am</em> not!”</p>

<p>And then she had to hurry away, which really left them
about where they had begun, so far as their curious little
lagging love affair went.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>But he made another determined effort under the romantic
influence of Flora Utterbourne’s garden tea-party. The tea
was strong and dreamy. He made Lili stroll off with him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
onto the beach, though she wanted to stay and enjoy every
moment of what seemed to her a function of the highest social
prestige. And he kissed her, behind a friendly palm tree,
and begged her once more to marry him, but she <em>wouldn’t</em> be
serious, and kept singing and making eyes in the most tempting
yet at the same time exasperating way, and sometimes
she said, “Boo-o-o!”</p>

<p>Try as he might, Jerome couldn’t seem to arrive anywhere
with Lili, even though she did admit she was desperately in
love with him: she always proclaimed the heartening fact
loudly and brazenly—didn’t care at all who knew it—was
candidness itself. Well, the combination was beyond Jerome,
and it humiliated him; it made his ego squirm. There
seemed to be a hoo-doo at work somewhere.</p>

<p>He brooded over his troubles of the heart. The same thing
seemed happening that had happened before, though with
the notable exception that whereas Stella had simply ceased
to love him and had married another man, Lili went right on
loving him—she admitted it! She was pretty deep.</p>

<p>And she seemed—yes, he glimpsed the fact indistinctly—she
seemed to be having certain flirtations on the side,
which darkened the issue considerably. There was a soldier
he had seen her with one day—a mere little shrimp in khaki,
on duty here in Honolulu. It troubled him greatly, and he
reproached her with it afterward; and she beamed on him
and evaded the point, even cried a little, and made him end
by feeling abject and penitent. Upon the whole, Jerome
appeared doomed.</p>

<p>However, all this made no particular stir in the great world.
The tea-party went right ahead. The songbirds were all having
a beautiful time, and the coloratura, Miss Valentine,
thrilling still over her Honolulu notices, walked about
haughtily, not seeing any one at all, and holding her teacup
with a poise which would have thrown Galesburg (whence she
had been rescued from a career of choir-singing nonentity)
into a spasm of amazement and envy. She talked with
a mysteriously acquired “eastern” accent, almost never forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
that the letter <i>r</i> did not legitimately belong in the
alphabet.</p>

<p>Small tables were set out under an awning: you could sit
with your tea or stroll with your tea, just as you chose. The
hostess poured the tea and smiled in her unflagging way, conversing
steadily; the river flowed cordially on, its rhythm unflecked
by churning millwheel or breaking rapids: a deep and
gracious river, quiet and gliding, yet sunny, too, and always
singularly fresh and aglow with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>There was one distinguished guest who hadn’t been invited,
and whose calm, sauntering arrival upon the scene created a
genuine little sensation. This was Captain Utterbourne, whose
<i>Star of Troy</i> had slipped into the harbour like a clever grey
mouse. He was on his way back from somewhere in the
Indian Ocean. Attired in cool flannels, he sat taking in the
mixed picture which kept constantly breaking into new composition
against the plush of the lawn and the blue of the sea.
His eyes were amused, yet otherwise inexpressive.</p>

<p>Flora was enthroned like a very queen behind a comfortable
big yellow teapot, with her enigmatic brother on one side and
the impresario on the other. Mr. Curry looked about him
dreamily, while a sense of peace seemed creeping into his
heart. It was amazing that a place like this should have so utterly
settled an appearance. It had been a mere empty house,
and she had come and waved a wand or something, and lo!
you would say she had always lived here. In a little while
she would be gone—vanished; there would be strangers. So
it went with her.</p>

<p>“My dear <em>man</em>,” she said richly, “your tea must be <em>stone</em>
cold! Let me give you a fresh cup, and you must try this
cake, <em>really</em>, for I made it myself, to see whether I’d forgotten
<em>how</em>—I don’t have <em>time</em> any more for such luxuries as ‘baking.’”</p>

<p>“Time,” murmured the Captain with a sleepy nod. “Time—and
eternity....”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>now</em>,” his sister countered, “you can’t eliminate my
‘responsibilities’ just by talking like a <em>Buddhist</em>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“Of course,” he admitted, “one may call things by whatever
names one chooses—h’m? You choose to call them responsibilities.”</p>

<p>“You’ve always laughed at my <em>apartments</em>, Chris: but I can’t
see that they’re any more uncertain than <em>ships</em>!” And there,
in truth, she really had him.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>It was all very delightful. And before long the illustrious
coloratura was prevailed upon to sing a few songs, though she
said the usual things about being in wretched voice, without
expecting that they should be taken too seriously.</p>

<p>The impresario excitedly seated himself at the piano and
spread out some music and they conferred in earnest whispers.
He sat looking up at her with such a look of loving and hopeful
anticipation as must move any one not utterly barricaded
against sentiment. It was really beautiful to see them together.
He was so manifestly proud of the songbird he had rescued
from the Galesburg choir, while she showed such touching confidence
in him—even if, when the strain was all over and bouquets
of praise poured in, she would forget to give the zealous
maestro any particular credit.</p>

<p>The singer drew in deeply, lowered her head a little, focused
the whole force of her being into the momentous first tone, and
sang. It was an aria from that sublime and noble work, <cite>Linda
di Chamounix</cite>, in which, of course, the heroine goes mad in
the second act or so, for no entirely apparent reason, and lets
her hair down her back, and sings cascades in competition with
a long-suffering flute. The “business end” of Miss Valentine’s
voice was the vital stretch between B and E; it was these impressive
top notes that made her, in reality, a coloratura to be
reckoned with—that kept the harassed impresario also in a
state of perpetual alarm.</p>

<p>“It’s her range,” he confessed afterward to Flora. “It puts
me so on pins and needles. Every time she opens her mouth
I’m afraid of losing her to one of the big managers.” He was,
indeed, forever finding pearls on ash-heaps, for ultimate confiscation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
higher up. “Lord, the singers I’ve lost because of a
little special talent!” Curry dropped his hands from an expended
gesture and wriggled the jewelled fingers helplessly.
“They’ll get her—you’ll see. I can’t afford to keep a voice
like that.” So life went. “From him who hath not....”
Xenophon Curry was a born impresario, carrying in his heart
a genuine sense of lift and grace which always touched his poor
ragged performances with at least the virtue of lyrical buoyancy;
but an impresario, alas, born to mediocrity and the
provinces.</p>

<p>Presently Captain Utterbourne’s eyes became riveted upon
a couple strolling back from the beach.</p>

<p>“Mr. Curry,” he drawled, his lips curling in mirth, “if I’m
not mistaken, that’s the young man you had to dinner at the
Pavillon d’Orient.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed the impresario, “and thereby hangs a tale”—which
he forthwith told, in his big, human way, omitting
some of the more painfully satiric touches and stressing rather
the new grip on life and the affairs of the world which the once
obscure clerk seemed obtaining.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it simply gorgeous,” murmured the Captain in a tone
of softly contemplative ecstasy, “the multiplicity of ever fresh
reactions one discovers in the human organism! Here one
sees a perfectly ordinary and unimaginative young man—h’m?—going
along year after year. Then suddenly he’s carried off
by a caprice of fortune and placed in a wholly new environment—h’m?
And immediately the mechanism of consciousness
begins to act along unpremeditated lines—throws up
defences—digs trenches of new affirmation—h’m? h’m? It’s
extraordinary—that alertness, that look of vigorous ‘becoming’....”</p>

<p>And the Captain sat there watching Jerome and watching,
his eyes half closed in a quizzical, poising way.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Jerome had failed with Stella; she had thrown him over
for another man; now he had found Lili—had almost
desperately, without quite realizing it, seized upon her.
He needed her—that is, his ego needed her. It wasn’t an aggressive
or egregious ego; certainly there was nothing of a
Don Juan about it! But it was a decently masculine ego, and
stood possessed of a salient sense of dignity. Under the circumstances,
even had Lili’s spell been less rare and beautiful,
it could have required no prodigious effort to convince himself
that he loved her. As time went on and his brave new life unfolded,
what elements of sheer convenience in it all there
might be obtruded less and less.</p>

<p>Her wonderful eyes, her gay manners, never failed. He
couldn’t help himself—didn’t <em>want</em> to—idealized her lavishly
because he really loved her, though behind that, subtly, because
his ego loved her. Had he pried down deep into his heart—ah,
but this was no time for prying; it was a time for living!
He loved, and laid long plans into the future, and more or less
realised, underneath all his reverses, that it was proving the
happiest and most consistently advancing period of his life—even
if Lili did keep holding off.</p>

<p>And indeed he didn’t, after all, have time to sit down much
and brood over his troubles; for entirely aside from matters
of heart interest he was a full fledged business man, now,
with problems to work out, increasing responsibility, tricky
accounts to keep straight. Jerome was proving to Mr. Curry
that much of the business of contracting for cargo could be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
entrusted to him. He was getting first-hand information about
everything connected with shipping and insurance; worked
right along with the broker—who might be a little inclined to
chuckle over occasional evidence of a rather unusual naïveté,
but who soon perceived he was dealing with nobody’s fool
when it came to figures.</p>

<p>The impresario looked on with a glow of thanksgiving and
relief, and was very glad indeed, as things had turned out,
that Tony and Alfredo had put the clerk in the supply closet.
“Lord, Lord! It’s wonderful the progress that boy is making!”</p>

<p>Yes, Jerome found the world a great place. And the most
valuable lessons of all were lessons of contact with men—of
all sorts, yet nearly all prepared to get the better of their
fellows if possible.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>But through everything ran the thread of his queer courtship.
Lili baffled him, yet lured him on and on. And he
<em>wanted</em> to be lured. He couldn’t understand her, but he certainly
couldn’t give her up, either; did a man ever give a
woman up because he couldn’t understand her?</p>

<p>Perhaps the worst of it was that Lili kept going places with
that same wretched soldier. Where had she ever picked him up,
and who did he think he was, anyhow? Jerome brooded
murder. He brooded almost everything conceivable, between
sessions with the broker, and when he wasn’t checking up with
the house manager. Sometimes he would stoutly decide never
to speak to her again. But the next day she would so overwhelm
him with her beaming and her loud, determined sweetness
that contrary impulse would melt away. Jerome was
simply a lump of putty in her hands.</p>

<p>But of course Lili didn’t by any means always treat him
so badly. Sometimes for long stretches she would be quite
lovely. On Sundays—all but one, when she disappeared in
company with the miserable meddling soldier—Lili and
Jerome took excursions about the island, sometimes alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
and sometimes with a gay party of their friends. Oh, the
skies were not by any means altogether leaden.</p>

<p>The prosperous season in Honolulu closed on a Saturday
night, and the <i>Skipping Goone</i> was scheduled for departure
the following Monday. Jerome and Lili went on a final jaunt,
this time a bit more ambitious than any of the others. They
found they could take an early morning boat over to Hilo
and return late at night.</p>

<p>It was a very joyous occasion. Both were in good spirits,
and the weather was gracious. They saw as much of the
larger island of Hawaii as they could, and had faced back
toward town when Lili conceived a sudden desire to pause at
a charming little roadside tavern for a supper of lobster and
wine—lobster being a specialty, as they learned from a sign
stretching out from the door. Lili grew very much excited.</p>

<p>“My mouth is just all set for it,” she said, speaking succulently,
as though already beginning to delight her palate with
the proposed feast.</p>

<p>And her companion admitted he was as hungry as a bear.
“We’ll stop,” he agreed, glad enough to prolong the enjoyment
of this last trip.</p>

<p>“How much money have we got between us, Jerry? You
have my purse in your pocket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have plenty,” he replied, with a firmness that set
her pleasantly humming. Lili loved firmness in the male—especially
when it concerned finances.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Over the lobster she flashed her pretty teeth at him in a
mood of increasing jollity. Lili’s hair was somewhat wind-blown,
and she had a high glow—touches which added a
deeper poignancy to the perennial charm of her beaming.
And as they sipped their white wine and nibbled their lobster
in cosy intimacy, Jerome felt himself more and more falling
under the spell.</p>

<p>It was the old spell of Lili herself, but it was also the spell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
of the hour and the place. Their being out together like
this had a fine adventurous tang. He reached across the table
and gave her hand a quick, fervent squeeze. He was so excited
he could hardly eat.</p>

<p>Lili was certainly in a wonderful mood. He had never
before seen her so utterly enjoying herself. And the more
of the friendly wine they drank, the more completely did
their respective moods take possession of them—also the less
did they think about the growing lateness. When at last it
occurred to them there was a boat to catch in Hilo, they
found, by consulting their watches and the proprietor of the
tavern, it would be quite impossible for them to reach Hilo
in time. At first the inn-keeper thought there was a special
later boat on Sunday, but it developed, when he consulted
a much-thumbed time-table, that it was out of season. And
then they were in a good deal of a panic, until the man told
them of a boat that left quite early in the morning; a stage
made connections somewhere—it was a little vague, but the
inn-keeper agreed to get them up in plenty of time.</p>

<p>There remained a remote and much less gripping panic
over the thought of possibly not reaching Honolulu in time
to get aboard the <i>Skipping Goone</i>, but Lili pointed out: “I
know Mr. Curry wouldn’t have the heart to go without us!”
And anyway, there was no use trying to cross more than one
bridge at a time. She giggled a little. There was nothing
they could do but remain and make the best of it. After
reaching this decision their spirits rose again very rapidly.</p>

<p>They wandered out of the tavern arm in arm for a little
stroll. There was a gorgeous moon, spreading all about them
a realm of intoxicating tropical splendour. Lili drew closer
to him and sighed: “It’s grand, isn’t it Jerry?” Her tone
was a little reverent, as it generally was when she felt herself
overcome by the beauty of the night.</p>

<p>They wandered together a little way down the still, white
road. Jerome felt the girl gently relaxing against him.
There was a thrilling softness and deliciousness in the contact.
He slipped an arm about her. Impulsively they paused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
and kissed. It was a wonderful, lingering kiss, and Jerome
found his hands tremblingly in her hair.</p>

<p>The night was lustrous and so unutterably sweet. They
turned at last and slowly walked back to the tavern. And the
spell endured.... He held her hand hotly. In the shadow
of some feathery trees he pressed his cheek against hers,
and they kissed again.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jerry!” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I love you!” he said.</p>

<p>Their hearts beat rapidly and their voices trembled when
they spoke to each other. They felt themselves irresistibly
drawn together.</p>

<p>The urge was strong and sweet. They gave themselves
up to it, and the night was theirs. Yes, theirs. All the lustrous
beauty and mystery of it, long and golden, with cares put
aside until the morrow, and only in their hearts the strange,
rich, poignant thrill which held them so breathless and made
their kisses seem immortal....</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">The next day they made Honolulu once more, with
several hours to spare.</p>

<p>The <i>Skipping Goone</i> was all prepared, at a little before
sundown, to sail away from the triumphant scene of Xenophon
Curry’s first venture. Everything was ship-shape. The
scenic effects, which had looked so tattered and shabby coming
down through the dawn in trucks, were housed beneath
their particular hatch in the umber cavern set apart for their
stowage. The cargo was placed. The Custom House had
pocketed its dues, issued a bill of health, and handed over
the requisite clearance note, which Captain Bearman pinned
to one of the leaves of the book in which he kept the log.
An almost dense crowd was on the wharf to wave God-speed.
It was a picturesque and really moving scene.</p>

<p>“You must <em>remember</em>,” Flora was saying, “that I always
<em>knew</em> you could do it!” She spoke earnestly, and her fine
eyes were unusually bright. She gestured a little.</p>

<p>Mr. Curry felt upon him a lingering sentimentality, and
asked, his voice curiously afflicted with huskiness: “When
do you suppose I’ll ever see you again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, perhaps much sooner than either of us <em>dreams</em>,” she
replied, as cheerfully as she could considering the queer tug
of emotion at her heart.</p>

<p>His look was wistful and solemn, though his wonderful
smile broke through at last.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she said warmly. “I’ll be watching for your
letters so <em>eagerly</em>, and you know I’ll be wishing you the very
finest ‘success’ all the <em>time</em>, for there won’t be a <em>day</em> without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
its thought of where you <em>are</em> and what fortune is <em>doing</em> for
you!”</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, and he held it just a moment with
a lingering pressure. It was ever so much more intimate
and understanding than the farewell in San Francisco. Then
he sighed and went aboard his schooner. She smiled and nodded,
her lips silently forming the word “good-bye” over
and over again, long after the ship had sped beyond earshot;
and he could see her handkerchief still hopefully fluttering
when the <i>Skipping Goone</i> had passed the first bounds of the
harbour and was beginning to settle to the heave of the outer
sea.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Some weeks later the adventurers had proceeded as far as
Tahiti, encountering little notable resistance from the elements,
and were coming, one and all, to feel like thorough-going
mariners.</p>

<p>On a day when the sun was bright and the shadows were
long and cool, Jerome and Lili sat smoking cigarettes together
in the lounging room of the hotel. She was sitting in the
chair recently vacated by the Tahiti broker, who had done
as well in the matter of cargo as mortal man could do, received
his modest fees, and had been telling Jerome tales of Tahitian
life and saying good-bye over some glasses of rum. The
broker was gone now, and Lili had crept in. She had begged
Jerome to sit down again, and had asked for a cigarette.
Then, quite without warning, she had burst into tears—and
this is where the curtain really rises.</p>

<p>Jerome looked at her in bewilderment. “<em>Lili!</em>” he cried.
“What’s happened?”</p>

<p>Shutters were drawn to keep out the glare, and the whole
town seemed sleeping.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand it any longer, Jerry!” she sobbed desperately,
but in a very little, tear-drenched voice.</p>

<p>“Tell me what it is, Lili,” he begged, going round beside
her and laying a comforting hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“Don’t cry any more, but just try to tell me what it is.
I know I can help you, whatever the trouble is.” Yes, he
was making progress!</p>

<p>She shook her head miserably. With a quick movement
she drew his head down and whispered. He drew back with
a little start, and from the look on his face it was very apparent
they had come to a crisis in their relationship.</p>

<p>Slowly he sank down into his chair again, and sat facing
her across the empty rum glasses. At first he seemed too
dumbfounded for words, but presently muttered: “Why
didn’t you tell me right off, Lili?” And then, as she merely
continued to sob, he went on more forcefully: “Cheer up.
It’s not too late, at that, is it? Nobody’s going to stop to
figure up the time.” His conviction was considerable, though
it did not rest upon experience.</p>

<p>“All I wish is I could just die and be out of the way!”
she moaned.</p>

<p>Her eyes were very red, her hair was ruffled and hot-looking.
It occurred to Jerome, almost critically, that she might
have chosen a less frequented place than the lounge of the
hotel for her upsetting confidence, although the room was,
it is quite true, deserted and silent. Then it came to him that
she had really set out just to be jolly with him in an effort
to forget her troubles, and that suddenly her courage had
failed.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk like that, Lili,” he begged, knocking the ash
carefully off his cigarette. “It’s nothing anybody can help
now, and I’m ready to marry you right off, whenever you say.
Come on. Let’s go out now and see if we can’t manage to
scare up a license and a parson. There must be a way here
as well as in civilized places.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do any good,” she said wretchedly, elbows on the
edge of the table, her chin in her hands, and her head shaking
a slow, mournful negation.</p>

<p>“Come on, buck up, Lili! I hate to see you like this.”</p>

<p>She gazed across at him with rueful eyes, in which there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
was no beam at all now. Lili’s eyes never seemed to look
quite natural unless they were beaming.</p>

<p>“I got along just fine until I met you,” she lamented, almost
with an air of reproach, though no one could honestly reproach
Jerome very heavily with having lured astray a girl
of Lili’s qualities, experience, and temperament. As a
matter of fact, her conscience troubled her a little about that
wretched soldier....</p>

<p>“I feel just as bad over it as you do,” Jerome assured her.
“But I can’t see the good of sitting here crying.”</p>

<p>“You can’t understand how a woman feels, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” he admitted, at the same time realizing that
at any rate he knew just how a man feels under the circumstances.</p>

<p>It wasn’t an agreeable feeling. It was a feeling, in fact,
that would have knocked the bottom right out of his small
universe a few months ago. But his universe was growing
bigger, and he seemed to be growing along with it. In
the old days Jerome would hardly have known what to do with
obligations of any but the most rudimentary sort. But he
had digested a perfectly marvellous fund of experience.
The old unfledged Jerome, who used to eat his lunches on the
step of the factory that made a leader of forty-nine cent
chocolates, would no doubt have frozen with horror at the
notion of sitting down opposite a girl and discussing such an
issue as this. But now, while very far indeed from looking
upon it as a pleasant situation, or one that could be handled
with any degree of lightness, Jerome conceived it a natural
enough thing to be a partner in the dilemma: the obligation
was one he had helped to create. A man wasn’t a man who
would allow himself to be scandalized by what had to be,
no matter <em>what</em>.</p>

<p>He was at once so advanced and still so immature—knew
life and didn’t yet know life, in a breath. But he argued
with blunt assurance: “Don’t you see, Lili? All we have to
do is get married. Everything will be all right.” He threw
away his cigarette and, reaching over between the empty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
glasses, drew the girl’s hands gently down into his on the table.
“I’ve tried hard enough to make you marry me; now, perhaps,
you’ll listen to reason!” But he smiled a little sadly, for his
ego told him there was something radically wrong about the
way his romance was running.</p>

<p>“Jerry,” said the girl at length, looking at him seriously,
“I guess the time’s come when I’ve got to tell you the truth
about me. I can’t marry you, even now, because I’m married
already.”</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>He stared at her, unable for ever so long to grasp the staggering
new situation her words established.</p>

<p>Married! But how could she be? How <em>could</em> she? Who
was her husband? Where was he? Questions that were
the groping articulation of an ever deepening incredulity.
And she answered them as well as she could, the answers,
on her part, equally groping through the articulation of
despair.</p>

<p>Well, she had married a man twice her age when she was
seventeen. They had lived together only about a year. Then
she left him. That was really about all. Her little story
sounded so desperately hackneyed as she poured it out, with
increasing enthusiasm, to Jerome.</p>

<p>She was singing in a cabaret when they met. Why she
had married him could hardly be thought of as an essential
question. Such marriages occur constantly, without rhyme
or reason, and nothing on earth can prevent them or their
often dismal consequences. She pleased him and he married
her. He was without money and drank and had a heavy
tendency toward sportiness. They tried to set up a little home
in one bare room of a boarding house. It wasn’t very authentic.
Her naturally happy and irresponsible nature drooped
under a cloud of incompatibility. They fought. Things
went from bad to worse. She began slipping back to her old
life in the cabaret. Finally she disappeared entirely. She
never saw her husband again. That was all there was to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>Lili might consistently have had a totally different story,
but she couldn’t possibly have a story that wasn’t reminiscent
of thousands and thousands of other stories, not Lili. There
was nothing very definite about it. She seemed always like
some wayward, brazen child, with no faculty for doing justice
to the serious facts of life. One could not listen without
laughter, even though silent; nor could one listen quite
without the sudden tightening of tears.</p>

<p>Jerome’s gaze never left her face, and she seemed glad of
his sincere, almost passionate attention. It might be nothing
could alter her present plight, but there was refreshment, like
the long refreshment of an utterly spent emotion, in baring
her heart completely to some one of whose comradely sympathy
she was sure.</p>

<p>When she had told Jerome the whole story, she sat with
her hands in her lap, leaning forward a little in a limp way.</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for this, Jerry, I’d have married you
long ago. But I couldn’t bear to tell you about it—I haven’t
told anybody at all, because I’ve wanted to be free. I’ve even
tried to kid myself into forgetting. Sometimes it all seems
so long ago. I nearly did tell you once, Jerry—that first
night we sat out on the schooner and you were so sweet to
me. But I couldn’t seem to, and after that every time it got
harder. I used to think: maybe a letter will come saying
he’s dead! It’s awful queer how far you can kid yourself.
The day you made love to me so hard behind the scenes in
Honolulu I almost told myself I’d just decide he’d gotten a
divorce from me long ago, and go ahead and marry you,
Jerry. But then I happened to remember about some people
I used to know who were arrested for bigamy, and I got cold
feet.”</p>

<p>Jerome sat staring. Here were shallows and depths he had
not glimpsed before. He shuddered a little at the thought of
the thin ice on which he had been plunging in pursuit of his
unhappy little romance. The word bigamy, which fell so
lightly from her lips, sent a vague shiver through him. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
was as though, suddenly and for the first time, he realized
that he and Lili moved on different planes....</p>

<p>He seemed dazed. “It doesn’t seem possible to think of
you married, Lili!” Then, as though stimulated by the very
sense of chaos which was just then so strong in his heart,
Jerome asked her: “Why can’t you get a divorce from him?”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done,” she returned listlessly. But she began
eyeing Jerome just a little shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well,” she rambled, rubbing her hands together in a
dreamy, irrational way, “I sometimes thought I’d find out
how I could get one, but I never seemed to have time, and
I’ve always heard it’s not so easy. I don’t know. I never
knew how anybody went to work to get a divorce. And then,”
she continued with a far-away look in her wide eyes, “you
see I don’t know where he is, for another thing. Don’t you
have to produce the evidence in a case like that? I don’t
know how it is in divorces. We lived most of the time in
two or three boarding houses in Chicago. I don’t know where
he came from. We just met.”</p>

<p>Jerome looked across at her forlornly. The shabby pathos
of her wretched little past gave him a feeling of stuffiness
and depression. He seemed to see before him a quite new
and more than ever perplexing Lili—felt himself almost a
stranger in her life.</p>

<p>Not to offer to marry her hadn’t even occurred to Jerome—not
so much because he was any sort of a moral giant as because
it had become so natural a thing to want to marry Lili
that impetus carried him along over the rough road of their
new relationship. The facts in the case merely made simple
and inevitable what he had all along desired. However,
here was a new and startling complication. His mind was in
a curiously mixed condition, and he asked himself in bewilderment
what steps remained to be taken. He would willingly
help some other way, if he could only decide what would
help. They sat together over the empty rum glasses. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
world had been so fair; now it seemed a very shabby and
sordid place.</p>

<p>Lili dropped her head down onto her arms, folded before
her on the table. Her shoulders trembled a little, and he
knew she was crying again.</p>

<p>Jerome’s heart was deeply touched. Surely, he thought,
there must be some way for him to put out his hand and
help. He had forgotten all her lightness, all the torments
he had endured for the sake of love. In the confusion of
his heart there was something almost like exaltation. He
spoke to her gently.</p>

<p>When she raised her head and took up the sorry theme
again, it was at exactly the point where it had lapsed so miserably.
“Divorce wouldn’t do any good, anyhow, about what
I’ve got into now.”</p>

<p>“No,” he agreed thoughtfully, “I guess it wouldn’t.” He
felt desperately remorseful.</p>

<p>But that vaguely cunning look in her eyes remained, behind
the tears and behind the hopelessness of her position.
After a moment, squeezing his hand a little, she murmured:
“Jerry, there’s just one way out, if—if you’d be willing to
do it—for my sake.”</p>

<p>He brightened. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“Well,” she hesitated, “nobody knows I’m married but you—nobody
in this part of the world, anyhow, and I....”
It was a little more difficult than she had realized, for she
knew that Jerome sometimes had queer ideas about convention.</p>

<p>“Go on and tell me, Lili,” he encouraged.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” she continued, “what I thought of was why
couldn’t we just tell them we’d run off all of a sudden and
got married?”</p>

<p>“I—I never thought of that!” he stammered, blushing.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jerry,” cried the girl bursting into a fresh flood of
rather easy tears, “I’m in such a fix I don’t know what to do,
my Gawd, I don’t!”</p>

<p>“Well,” he soothed, “don’t cry any more. We’ll do that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
then, Lili.” And after a little pause he added, with a note of
resigned whimsy: “There won’t even be need of any license.
It isn’t quite the way I always pictured myself getting married,
but you can’t always have <em>everything</em> just the way you
want it.”</p>

<p>Relief stole all the gloom out of eyes that were made for
beaming. She ignored, or failed to sense, the finer phase of
what he would be missing in the curious transaction.</p>

<p>“All you’ll need will be just a wedding ring, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s all, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll buy that for you right away now, if they have
any in Tahiti. I guess I’ve enough saved up. I’ll see.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Jerry,” she said, reviving rapidly. “That won’t
be necessary. I still have my other wedding ring put away.
I can use that one, and nobody will ever know any difference—will
they?” And she added quite cheerfully: “It’s a lucky
thing I kept it! I’d hate to have you going and spending all
that money.” Her tone was almost magnanimous.</p>

<p>“All right,” he replied dully. “I’d sort of like to buy the
ring at least, but of course it’s true no one would ever know
the difference.”</p>

<p>He was tapping the ends of his fingers thoughtfully on the
table. She wiped her eyes and smiled: “You know we may
have need of all our money later on—when the time comes.”</p>

<p>She was actually beginning to beam on him again; and she
asked, with a tremor of almost happy excitement in her voice:
“How shall we work it, Jerry? Could we do it this afternoon,
so I could flash my ring around tonight?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much to do, is there?”</p>

<p>“No,” she laughed. “There isn’t much any one can do for
this kind of a wedding!”</p>

<p>“You better get your ring and we’ll disappear for the rest
of the afternoon. And when we come back you can be wearing
it. We’ll fix up a story in the meantime.”</p>

<p>“Will you wait down here?” She was beaming extravagantly.
Lili was herself again.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll wait here,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“Oh,” she tittered, jumping up, “it will be such a grand
joke on everybody, if they only knew!” She laughed a little
hysterically. Her problem was solved. “I won’t be gone a
minute, Jerry!”</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">The mats were drawn at the windows and the lamp was
lighted in their “parlour.” It was a night of warm
nervous wind, and, though the pounding of the surf
produced a roar which neither rose nor fell, the jungle,
stirred by shifting gusts, seemed full of nocturnal caprice, and
sounded a broken note of <i lang="it">tempo rubato</i>—as so often it did,
only to make the dreamy stillness of the following dawn more
poignant.</p>

<p>It was a quiet evening at home. King had been enjoying a
glass of after-dinner brandy, and, as was apt to be the case at
such times, the exuberance of his mood brought a soft shine to
Stella’s eyes. Just faintly of late it had been necessary to
brush aside vexing little cobwebs that seemed, in spite of her,
weaving question and debate about the edges of her
romance.... But tonight she saw how unfounded were any
quavers she might entertain—the kiss that had brought a
frown—Tsuda’s sombre disclosures.... No, she would
never let her mind drift into a web of ephemeral doubts again;
she was done with morbid “premonitions” for ever—they were
intruders.</p>

<p>Every marriage, she reasoned, must call for certain adjustments—concessions,
if one preferred phrasing it that way.
Whenever her husband seemed brusque or abstracted, inclined
to forgetfulness of her, she would remind herself that he had
a new business on his hands. How foolish to grope, ever; to
feel perturbed, unequipped! And she would only laugh when
a curious phrase of his came back to her: “Just imagine what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
it would have been like if I had come here alone...!” An
oddly impersonal note it was, which had given her a jolt;
though now she told herself it was because she had been in a
mood of hyper-sensitiveness. Without realizing it, she softly
laughed aloud, her thoughts playing in rumination.</p>

<p>“Tell us the joke, peaches!” he suggested in his bluff, magnetic
way.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she replied, her eyes still shining. “I was only
thinking how wonderful it all is!”</p>

<p>And she drew her arms gently about her husband’s neck.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>A sudden gust of wind whipped one of King’s papers off the
table where he sat figuring opium problems. It went skimming
across the floor, and Stella thrust out a foot to intercept
its flight: a spontaneous act which set her husband musing in a
rather odd way.</p>

<p>“You’ve a remarkably narrow foot, haven’t you Stella?” he
said. “I noticed it even that first time we met in the street.”</p>

<p>“Have I?” she laughed, fluttering a little—a mannerism her
husband still possessed the magic potency to inspire.</p>

<p>He seemed to be studying her foot with an abrupt and quite
absorbed interest.</p>

<p>“It’s not very often—” He broke off and glanced up with
a rather furtive smile. “I mean—you must wear about a
double A, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“How did you guess?” she laughed. She adored Ferdinand
in this sort of personal, gently intimate mood. It somehow,
very subtly, compensated for the splendours not yet come to
pass....</p>

<p>King eyed her shoe attentively. There was even something
trancelike in his gaze. When he spoke again it was with a
touch of far-away dreaminess. “Double A,” he half chanted,
“with a short instep—yes—and one of those Standish heels
they’re using such a lot now....” He glanced up again,
this time with a faint start, and found Stella gazing at him
amused, perplexed a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“That’s just what the man at the shoe store said,” she smiled.
“You’re terribly clever!” And when her husband, a look
still detached and a shade self-conscious in his round blue
eyes, had taken possession of the sheet of paper she had rescued,
and had returned to his work at the table, Stella sat meditating.
But ever, quaintly, through her reverie, like a whimsical
refrain, ran the thread of King’s words: “Double A—with
one of those Standish heels....”</p>

<p>Suddenly, as she looked at him, it seemed to Stella that he
was an utter stranger—she had never seen him till now—they
had not <em>really</em> married and come out here to this mysterious
unknown island. Just as abruptly the sensation passed; but
the girl still felt in her heart a shiver of nervous excitement,
and, in brooding mood, got up and roamed restlessly about the
house.</p>

<p>The wind romped outside with nervous starts and stops,
each gust strangely impelling her to fresh question and uninvited
quandary.</p>

<p>At length, impelled by a wave of romantic tenderness, Stella
paused in her roaming and leaned up against her husband, so
deeply absorbed in his task—acreage, crops, the problem of
irrigation. “Ferd, dear,” she murmured after a little.
“Ferd, dear—I keep feeling as though I’d have to wake up.
I know it’s foolish of me, but the strangeness doesn’t seem to
wear off. Does it ever come over you that way?”</p>

<p>“What?” he muttered, obviously only half conscious she
had spoken at all.</p>

<p>Stella caressed her husband’s hair, and, working one little
finger into his lapel buttonhole, coaxed: “Ferd—why <em>did</em> we
come to Hagen’s Island?”</p>

<p>He looked up at her then, a somewhat troubled expression
in his face. “Well,” he said slowly, his lips, so like a tender
cupid’s bow, touched with a smile of faint irony, “I guess it
was what one would have to call a case of grabbing up the first
thing in sight!”</p>

<p>“But—” Her look was a little troubled.</p>

<p>“Oh, I give you my word,” he laughed, “I’d have preferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
a good many places to this, despite its very superior cocoanuts
and sunsets—some place a trifle less remote. I’m sure I
never listened to such a lot of silence all at once in my life!
But here was the chance, and it had to be this or—well, something
a great deal more prosaic. Unfortunately,” he added,
“a man has to work for his living in this hard and unfeeling
world!”</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Her finger fell out of his buttonhole. “Oh...!” she half
cried, and in such an odd, overturned tone that, still smiling in
his princely way, he demanded: “You didn’t think I was made
of money did you, little lady?”</p>

<p>Hurriedly Stella shook her head, a bit alarmed for just a
moment lest she had placed herself in an unfortunate light.
Yet somehow she <em>had</em> always more or less associated Ferdinand
with at least the romantic abstract idea of money. The
illusion had been established upon the occasion of her first
glimpse of him, bursting like a bright symbol into her drab
life, his hand full of travel guides. Money—not for itself,
but the things it could do and the dreams it could realize....
Her returning smile seemed to crack a little, as her eyes, with
still their faintly troubled look, met his, then unconsciously
avoided them. It was, to some indefinite extent, a moment of
readjustment for her. The evening seemed all athrill with intangible
revelation....</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, a suggestion of bravado in his voice,
“speaking of Hagen’s Island and the business, you were responsible
yourself, Stella, for a whole lot of the soft pedaling.”</p>

<p>“I?” she asked, amazed, wondering at the drift.</p>

<p>His smile possessed elements of dryness. “The Captain
believes to this day you knew the essential facts beforehand.
But,” and her husband laughingly seized both her cheeks,
“after that day you said you liked having everything mysterious—well,
I didn’t have the heart to break in on any of your
dreams just then....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>“I see,” she said, a shade doubtfully. Her cheeks trembled
a little where his fingers had pinched.</p>

<p>“The Captain even tried to talk me out of getting married,”
pursued King, almost chattily. “The Captain always insisted
this was a man’s job. But that was all the good it did! Why
you dear little girl,” he went on, his tone warming and deepening
to considerable passion, “how could I ever get along without
you?”</p>

<p>But somehow those other words of his—those words unconsciously
yet so hauntingly <em>impersonal</em>—seemed ringing in
her ears instead: “—what it would have been like if I’d come
here—alone....”</p>

<p>“I know,” he admitted after a little pause, “time seems to
lag a bit. But after all, what’s six months?”</p>

<p>“Or even a year?” she bravely supplemented, catching somewhat
the spirit of his easy nonchalance.</p>

<p>It was, as a matter of fact, a trifle in the air: the Captain’s
was a complicated life. “If I’m not here—h’m?—by the
fifteenth of August,” he had told them, “or within a week of
that time—h’m?—you’ll know I’m not to be looked for until
February again.” But they refused to be dismayed.</p>

<p>“Yes, even a year,” King echoed her gaily. “A year’s
gone in no time. And then,” he laughed, “if we <em>can’t</em> stand
it any longer, why off we go, to some place more lively—maybe
where we can live in a cheerful, noisy little two-by-twice
flat with a dumb waiter and—”</p>

<p>“But you said—the rue de la Paix,” she reminded him, a
look of groping alarm in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, so I did.” He sighed a cheerful capitulation; and
then, with an odd effect of pulling himself together and getting
romantically “under way” once more, noisily pushed back
his chair, got up, and poured out some more brandy. “You’re
right, lady-bird. I’d forgotten about the hats. All right—it’s
really quite the same. We’ll go to Paris! And after that—perhaps
the Tyrol you’re always talking about. Or—I’ve got
it! We’ll saunter up the coast of Africa, through the Suez<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
canal, into the blue Mediterranean. Maybe you’ll want to go
on to Spain....”</p>

<p>He strode to a window and brushed back the mat roughly,
seeming, as he stood there, to drift miles away, while the blow
outside waned, and the jungle hushed itself beneath warm stars.</p>

<p>The troubled look returned to Stella’s eyes. “Oh, don’t
stop—please!” she urged. And it came to her dimly that this
was really the first time she had had, consciously, to prod his
grandeur.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Next morning it was still and sunny. Silence drifted softly
in from all sides through the aching beauty of this tiny empire.</p>

<p>Breakfast finished, King prepared to depart for the day,
turning at the door and nodding easily: “Don’t you worry,
little girl. As for such details as balls and theatres, it’s true
they’re not very plentiful. For your sake I wish we could
import some—it would be jolly. But don’t let your dear little
head forget,” he went on a trifle pompously, “that Hagen’s
Island is only a beginning. If I happened to be flush we’d be
taking a smashing honeymoon trip all over the globe—hitting
nothing but the high spots...!” His eyes flashed magnetically.
“But whatever your dreams are,” he continued,
slightly magisterial by virtue of his virile earnestness, “they’re
going to come true, later on. However high they sail—I
don’t care. You leave everything to me, little lady. <em>I’ve got
a hunch!</em>”</p>

<p>His regard strayed a little, although his words rang with
real fervour; and following his gaze Stella saw a young Ainu
woman passing swiftly by along a path which soon lost itself
in the steaming tropical maze. King watched her out of sight
with a look of glancing interest.</p>

<p>“That’s the great chief Cha-cha-kamui’s Small Wife,” he
muttered, a smile breaking. “Tsuda explained it the other
day. It seems there’s an official Great Wife; but she’s old and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
ugly, and—well, after all,” he laughed, “the world’s one piece
when it comes to that.”</p>

<p>He was hurrying away, and had mounted a pony when Stella
called to him, her voice faltering with a little shrill of unhappy
emotion.</p>

<p>“Oh Ferd—<em>don’t</em> go without a kiss!”</p>

<p>“There you are,” he smiled, bending down chivalrously from
the saddle to reach her lips.</p>

<p>At the crest of the tiny hillock he turned to wave again.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE QUARREL</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Weeks passed, and the opium harvest was in full
progress.</p>

<p>Tsuda was everywhere, sweating, swearing in
breezy English, heaving out torrents of instruction in Ainu,
to which the sad parties to this “experiment in transplanting”
would listen, though without taking the trouble to straighten
out of the cramped posture that went with their task of scarifying
the poppy capsules.</p>

<p>The new overseer, looking like a White Kami indeed in his
gleaming tropical clothes and smart hat, eyed Tsuda sharply,
his nostrils dilating a little.</p>

<p>“Things are going to be run here a little more scientifically
than they have been in the past, Tsuda,” he said with dry
briskness. “You’ve done very well with the Ainu—you understand
their ways and their language; but the business itself is
a little bit beyond your reach.”</p>

<p>It was a new aggressive way of speaking which had developed
gradually with King’s adjustment to the conditions of his
changed life. He had his bearings now, and enjoyed the tang
of power.</p>

<p>But Tsuda, no longer accorded quite the old freedom,
watched this development darkly. It was part of Tsuda’s
cleverness to be as colloquial as possible with people: it gave
him tone and status. However, of late King had taken to
bringing him up a little short and reminding him there was
only one boss on Hagen’s Island. This bothered Tsuda a
great deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“By the way,” said King, a half deprecating smile on his
lips, “it seems to me your people are beginning to sag a little.
I don’t think it would be a good thing to let them come to feel
that because I am about with them so much I’m less of a—well,”
he flung in rather harshly, “the matter of morale has
got to be looked after. For myself”—there was an impatient
though not altogether convincing gesture—“I realize it’s rubbish—all
your priest-stuff. But—well, you might let them
know I’m not too well pleased.” He stood whipping at the
top of an opium plant with his riding crop. “They’re inclined
to be lazy, these long-haired devils. We ought to find a way
to liven them a bit. Probably you’re too stingy with your
saké. Loosen up, Tsuda. I think,” he drawled (and it
amounted to a genuine little apogee of satisfaction with his
prerogative here) “I ought to get more work out of <em>all</em> you
people.”</p>

<p class="tb">The miserable Ainu prostrated themselves as he passed.
It was overwhelming and a trifle touching at the same time.</p>

<p>But Tsuda’s look was full of brooding discontent, though,
to be sure, this extreme ritual of respect was but a piece of
his own passionate handiwork. As he had just faintly hinted
to Stella, the Japanese would have been a priest—only there
was a clash with the Emperor’s police in his youth, resulting
in his deportation in irons to Yezo. “I never learned
for what,” the Captain once admitted to King. “Murder
most likely. The essential fact remains that he managed to
escape—h’m? And fancy my snatching him, years later—h’m?—out
of a brawl over a geisha girl!” The Captain always
had a humorous, twitching look at such times—and
especially when he had occasion to refer to Tsuda’s manipulation
of the Ainu—“religion—h’m?—that is, religion and
saké....” It had called for patience and cleverness on
Tsuda’s part; at length the thrall was complete. But as he
watched King now reaping this vicarious homage, and mused
upon the exalted niche King filled in Captain Utterbourne’s
scheme, Tsuda resented what more and more struck him as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
an intrusion—yes, more and more, while the <i>Star of Troy</i>
steamed steadily day and night into realms of new adventure
and prowess.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>King drew out a little revolver and emptied its contents
rapidly into the atmosphere. Stella would know by this
token he was at hand, and would be on the lookout for him.
Mr. King liked to have his wife at the door or half way
down the path to meet him. It went nicely with his conception
of married life. Also this fusillade, in the nature of a
virile salute, proved an agreeable way now and then of dispersing
the shroud of silence that seemed always to hover
like an invisible fog over island and sea, beneath a mocking
sky.</p>

<p>Stella did, indeed, come out a little way to meet her husband.
He waved to her with one of his fine flourishes, dismounted,
and when they met, bent and kissed her, and kept his arm
about her in a posture of comfortable possession as they
strolled toward the house.</p>

<p>“You ought to be thankful you can stay in the shade!” he
explained. “What wouldn’t I give for a little ice!”</p>

<p>She made no reply, but walked along as though musing,
her head downcast.</p>

<p>“I must say you don’t strike a very hilarious welcome!”
he assured her after a short silence. “Aren’t you glad to
see me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Look up here!” He raised her
chin with an uncompromising hand. Then she smiled faintly
and told him: “There’s nothing the matter—I just don’t feel
very lively. Has it been a hard day?”</p>

<p>“So-so. Look here, little girl, your eyes are red. Crying?”</p>

<p>“Only a little.”</p>

<p>“Homesick already?”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“This won’t do!” he exclaimed; and there was a dash of
high romance in his tone which had never until now failed
to thrill her. Perhaps it thrilled her even now, though she
burst into unexpected tears. And the tears loosed her tongue.</p>

<p>“If I could only write letters,” she sobbed. “It seems so
terrible to think the only word they’ll have at home for maybe
a whole year is the letter Captain Utterbourne took back
with him to mail. And even in that,” she rambled wretchedly,
“I was so much in the dark—there was so much that had to be
left unsaid....”</p>

<p>They had reached the house, and she sat huddled on the
doorstep. It was the first time she had really given way to
feelings of this sort, and the flood was proportionate. Her
husband stood looking down at her, somewhat perplexed.</p>

<p>“Stella, my dear child,” he suggested, “it’s no crime, you
know, just because we have to keep a bit still about it.
Opium’s a very valuable medical base—in India there’s
even a government monopoly. Yet you <em>insist</em> on thinking
of it only as a dope.” He laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” she sighed. “But I try not to, Ferd. It
all seems—I don’t know—so strange sometimes.... And
when I learned how they’ve been made to think of you as a
kind of supernatural being, Ferd—oh, I don’t know....
I can’t tell you how it made me creep when Tsuda....”
Her words groped, hot and half smothered.</p>

<p>King tossed his handsome head and laughed again easily,
in his grand way. “You see,” he told her, “it’s the only sure
method of getting hold of the Ainu imagination. We have
to use something a bit extreme. You mustn’t let a little thing
like that disturb you.” His smile was slightly supercilious.
“If the world never treated a man any worse than to make
a god of him, I for one shouldn’t feel like complaining! But”—and
now his look darkened and took on a glint of imperiousness,
“I see I’ll have to caution Tsuda to keep his religious
prattle to himself. I won’t have him giving you the jim-jams
with his ridiculous priest-ideas!”</p>

<p>Her emotion had quieted, and her eyes mused. “I really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
think he’s only a child at heart,” she said. “But sometimes
he frightens me suddenly....” King sat down beside her
on the step, so handsome and protecting; he took her fingers
and caressed them. “You’ve no idea how still it gets after
you’ve gone away to the fields,” she sighed.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow,” he said, “if you like I’ll take you a part of
the way so you can see the Ainu scraping opium—it’s quite
a sight.” She brightened. “And one of these days,” he
went on, “we must make a little excursion up to the grave of
Vander Hagen, the martyr Utopian—take our lunch along,
picnic style—and be thankful <em>we</em> didn’t get carried off on the
back of an ideal!”</p>

<p>Somehow, as he laughed in his light, careless way, she
remembered how Elsa had accused her once of having ideals.
It set her musing a bit. Then she found herself remembering,
too, how glibly her husband had spoken, long ago, about
whistling up the sun, sitting astride the pyramids. Now
would he whistle on the grave of the man who had come here
with a dream and broken his heart...?</p>

<p>“How long has it been,” King asked, “since the <i>Star of
Troy</i> left us?”</p>

<p>“Six weeks, Ferd.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sure</em> we haven’t skipped a month or two somehow?”</p>

<p>“I cross off each day on the calendar,” Stella said, much
more cheerful now the tears were spent. “Come in and I’ll
show you. I make quite a business of it!”</p>

<p>She took his hand and led him in. It was a little cooler
than outside; the mats at the windows made it quite dusky;
here and there on the walls a scrawny spider slept.</p>

<p>They stood together before the calendar: two leaves gone—in
a few days another; then in thirty days....</p>

<p>It was time that must be annihilated. Time—time—time....</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>“By the way, Stella,” he announced a few afternoons later,
standing a little arrogantly, legs braced apart, and moistening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
his lips with an appetizer, “your days of drudging are over
forever!”</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows in question, and he went on:
“I’ve ordered Tsuda to have a couple of Ainu women up here
in the morning for you to break in.”</p>

<p>“Servants, Ferd?” She was amazed.</p>

<p>“Quite at your disposal, my dear. And if they don’t
keep hustling and leave you free to fold your hands like a
lady, you let me know!”</p>

<p>“But Ferd—I don’t want any servants—I don’t need any!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you do. I know how you hate to wash and sweep.”</p>

<p>“But not any more, Ferd—I’d be quite lost without the
housework, what little there is!”</p>

<p>However, he didn’t like having his efforts set at naught.
“Nonsense,”—his tone was slightly dictatorial. “I don’t
propose to have you spend your life slaving.”</p>

<p>“Please tell them not to come,” she said, turning a little
pale, yet not quite consciously taking a stand. “I don’t want
any servants.”</p>

<p>They stood gazing at each other through a moment curiously
charged with something neither had foreseen or suspected.</p>

<p>Slowly a look of sharper lordliness crept into his eyes.
“Stella,” he said, “I’m determined to build up an establishment.
We ought to put on more style, even if we are living
’way out here. A little later I may train one of the Ainu
men for a personal valet.” He smiled a rather brittle smile.
“Do you think they’re pliable enough? It’s necessary to
keep these savages impressed,” he went on, “for the sake of
morale, if nothing else. Anyway—call it a whim, if you
want to—I’ve taken a dislike to having my dear little wife
washing dishes and beating mats.” It came back to her with
great vividness how he had frowned and closed his eyes the
morning she had put on her finery to please him. But,
smiling a slow, calm, magisterial smile, he added: “What
do you think the world would say if it could listen to
you objecting to help about the house, with the servant problem

<p>Had he refrained from smiling, or if he had just simply
and humorously smiled, she would undoubtedly have let the
matter drop there. But something new in the glint of his eye
and the self-willed curl of his lips struck an unexpected flint
within Stella. Her own eyes gleamed a little, and she grew
whiter.</p>

<p>“If we had the kind of big town house I once pictured,
it would be a very different thing. But here we are on this
island instead, and you don’t know what my housework has
come to mean or you wouldn’t talk of sending up Ainu
women to take it away from me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t carry on like a child, Stella,” he said, with a little
heat. For, though there was sense in her words, he did not
like the tone. It hadn’t a traditional ring, and—well, he
didn’t like it.</p>

<p>“I’m not carrying on like a child.” Her voice sounded
strained to her, and she was growing a bit hysterical.
“Please tell them not to come.”</p>

<p>He whistled softly, and after a rather tense pause announced:
“They’re coming early in the morning, Stella.” There was
a fling of his finely sculptured head.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to take charge of them!” she blazed out,
with a flash of spirit which checked and amazed him. It
was the first gauntlet of their life together—a gauntlet surcharged
with fiendish irony.</p>

<p>How the issue might have carried itself had Stella proceeded
in the same fashion is problematical; but when, amazed at
the state of affairs, and with her heart already much shaken,
she took in spite of herself a step inimical to progress by
surrendering to tears again, King shrugged and left the room,
a smile still torturing his lips.</p>

<p>There was a smugness about his victory which made the
girl writhe.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DINNER THAT NEVER WAS EATEN</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Confusion bore her violently out under the open sky.
From her favourite perch in the rocks the sea stretched
wide and dreaming, exquisite in the light of late afternoon.</p>

<p>At first Stella carried on the mood of this new rebellion.
Did he expect her to settle down on this lonely island like
a dull little mouse and meekly take whatever came to her,
without comment or protest? Was this the outcome of so
many romantic impulses all giving his princely word free rein?</p>

<p>It had seemed right and warmly within the picture that
her prince should wave his sceptre over her destiny, just as
in some tale of rich enchantment.... However, these were
days of pause; and there were points in the process of working
out which seemed, despite the office of rosy spectacles, not
altogether ideal.</p>

<p>Her mind groped and rambled afield. Jerome’s transgressions,
though dire, had been all in the opposite direction.
She thought of Elsa—how Elsa had dealt out caution over
the teacups. “You seem to be quite hypnotized,” she had
said, with drooping, disillusioned eyes. What would Elsa
say now? “If she were only here!” Stella longed for
some one with whom all these complex issues might be discussed;
and again she felt vaguely unequipped.</p>

<p>But being so alone, she grappled with her life as best she
could, though nothing seemed very clear.</p>

<p>As her anger cooled, Stella felt she had let herself go too
far—regretted, in due time, having stood out at all. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
made her attitude hardest now to defend was the fact that
Ferdinand’s whole idea seemed to be to make things easier
for her. Perhaps there might even be something in what he
said about the need of keeping the Ainu impressed. It was
dim and not a little terrifying. And certainly he was right
in suggesting the world’s amazement at such opposition as
she had brought to bear. Analysis in good time brought a
faint smile even, for, though it might not be salient, she really
did possess a sense of humour.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>An hour later the shadows had grown long and deep. The
sun loitered low in a sky silent and unfretted by cloud. A
tiny wisp of breeze was stealing about, stirring the mats at
the windows and making the doors creak whisperingly on
their jungle-vine hinges.</p>

<p>Stella was laying the table for their evening meal. Penitent,
she was determined, as women sometimes are, that the
dinner should be proportionately nice. Tears were not
beautifying, did not belong in her dream; nor did anger and
flashing eyes. Her best dress was protected, as she went
busily about her work, by one of the big, practical aprons
Maud had provided. She had opened some tins, and a cook
book was spread before her. It was to be rather special.</p>

<p>Stella sang a little, softly, as she worked, and was trying,
half consciously and not with entire conviction, to fancy that
instead of being here on this island, lost in a lonely sea,
they were living in Paris, she and Ferdinand, and that she
was preparing a little after-the-opera supper. What had the
opera been? Well, what were some of the operas? What
was Paris like?</p>

<p>The house was very still. Presently the little meal was
ready, and she went to call her husband. She was going
through the “parlour” toward the outer door, when, to her
surprise, she perceived that he wasn’t outside, as she had
supposed, but stretched instead on the cot. He lay perfectly
still, and she thought he must have fallen into a doze; but as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
she approached him she became aware that it was a doze of
a rather peculiar sort, for his eyes were wide open, and,
though she called to him, he did not move—did not seem even
aware of her presence. He looked strangely detached and
delighted.</p>

<p>Stella crossed the room, chilling with a sense of indefinable
terror. There was a pungent smell.</p>

<p>King’s lips were a little parted, and the expression on his
face was quite radiant. On a tabouret beside the cot stood a
tiny spirit lamp within a dome of glass open at the top. The
wick was lighted, and in the still, hot air the little flame
scarcely wavered. Beside it on the stand was something dark
and mysterious.</p>

<p>One of his hands lay, idly and with characteristic
grace, upon his breast, gently rising and falling with the
rhythm of the breath. The other hand had dropped down
on to the floor; the fingers curled, relaxed; and just beneath
them on the mat lay a curious little pipe.</p>

<p>Stella cried out softly. She felt numb, and despite the
heat her hands and brow were cold with damp. She could
not bear to touch him, and could not even make her lips move
to speak to him again. She went away.</p>

<p>The waiting dinner grew stale. Stella sat on the step outside.
The stars were feeble at first; then they were lustrous
and brilliant.</p>

<p>She did not know how long she sat there. It seemed very
late when he called to her, his voice thick and full of an
agony of physical reaction. She trembled and went in to him.
Somehow she managed to light the lamp, and tropical moths
fluttered softly all about it.</p>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">The marriage of Jerome and Lili naturally caused quite
a bit of romantic stir among the members of Xenophon
Curry’s little troupe. A very hilarious party was
given to celebrate the event, at which the happy bride and
bridegroom were toasted, and after which (for all this occurred
just on the eve of departure from Tahiti) they were
sent down to the <i>Skipping Goone</i> in a species of hack, much
festooned with ribbon and old shoes, and spattered with
rice.</p>

<p>Jerome felt the confusion of his curious position rather
keenly; but Lili appeared to fall in with the whole idea easily
enough. She enjoyed the send-off almost as much as though
it had been legitimate. Indeed, she had nearly all the sensations
of a legitimate bride. It was wonderful to be able to
find so agreeable and so entire a solution for her problem!</p>

<p>From Tahiti the course of the <i>Skipping Goone</i> lay southwest,
and the next stopping point in the world tour was New
Zealand, where, in the words of the comedian, a prosperous
fall season was “had by all.” New Zealand became ardent in
its endorsement of Xenophon Curry and his aggregation of
songbirds. But this endorsement was, in turn, entirely outdone
by that heaped up by Australia, where the company
left its “private yacht,” as they liked to call it, and went on
tour.</p>

<p>This carried them through the winter, and even into the
spring, for the tour was a little prolonged.</p>

<p>Lili dreaded the coming of her baby—dreaded it enormously.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Lili didn’t want any children; she looked upon the
ordeal with horror. Her mood was increasingly difficult to
meet as the months dragged on; and the brunt of this meeting
was borne by Jerome.</p>

<p>After the supreme night in Hawaii, his feeling for Lili had
begun to grow complex. The scene in the hotel in Tahiti,
again, had introduced new values into the picture. And then—well,
his marriage was not proving altogether a bed of roses.
No, it wasn’t. He could not deceive himself. Almost from
the beginning he had felt that it wasn’t going to be a bed
of roses. Yet how little he had foreseen such unhappy developments
as these back in San Francisco, when, so callow
and so lonely, he had first fallen under the fatal charm of
her beaming eyes!</p>

<p>Just after leaving Tahiti, it is true, they passed a few almost
happy weeks together, Lili being able so far to forget herself
and her own troubles a part of the time at least as to accord
Jerome all the affection even he could desire. On her side,
of course, it was affection subtly touched with gratitude; but
he responded to it eagerly, and made the most of this fleeting
sense of married felicity—even tried to assure himself it was
somehow a condition that might be brought to endurance,
despite all the unfortunate circumstances.</p>

<p>But more and more surely, as the weeks went by, he knew
that their marriage was but a word scrawled upon the sand
when the tide was low. He wasn’t wedded to Lili in any lasting
sense. He was, indeed, merely saving her from an unpleasant
experience. At length Jerome came to look upon
what he had done as a sheer act of duty—and an act which,
despite his own abiding sense of responsibility, grew slyly
irksome.</p>

<p>Lili revealed herself to him during these months at sea and
in New Zealand, and especially in Australia, when she became
wrapped up in her own mantle of brooding and petulance
and terror, as a being almost entirely devoid of any real
sympathy. Utterly shallow, he told himself. Utterly selfish.</p>

<p>Of course Jerome didn’t begin to appreciate the unhappiness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
of her condition. He didn’t know anything about such things,
and only saw stark qualities. In spite of rallying efforts,
his feeling for her cooled and cooled, till at length there was
little sentiment of any sort left. He even developed latent
subtleties in the way of avoiding her, and finally assured
himself it was a matter of profound thanksgiving that their
marriage <em>wasn’t</em> real, but only a word in the sand.</p>

<p>Yet he wondered, sometimes, too, whether they might have
been happier together if there had been a license, and if he
had bought the wedding ring.... For he had loved her once,
very extravagantly, and it bewildered him when he asked
himself where his love for her had gone—what had <em>happened</em>
to it.</p>

<p>Well, here were more “supreme emotions” to grapple with,
certainly.</p>

<p>Almost nothing notable had befallen him, he always felt,
during his existence previous to this amazing year; but once
the era of notable experiences set in, each seemed to make
in him a permanent and reorganizing difference. Jerome did
a lot of thinking these days. His adventures were coming
more and more to stand for elemental phases of human
relationship. He thought about Lili and his feeling for Lili;
thought about his strange and fugitive dip into matrimony;
saw his brief first happiness grow tarnished. When their baby
was born, what then? Would they go on living together
like this all the rest of their lives? A child would mean a
new responsibility—another obligation that couldn’t be
dodged....</p>

<p>“I guess I’m in for it,” he muttered, with real, disillusioned
grimness. Yes—very darkly in for it. And this was what
had come of his unshakable desire for—a hearth and kiddies.</p>

<p>Sometimes his consciousness of the dilemma attained rather
acute poignancy, and seemed on occasions, often trifling
enough, to dramatize itself—each repetition widening the
gulf a little. One night they had quarrelled, and she had
pouted and wept; then, all at once she had fallen asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>He watched her as she lay, undried tears on her cheeks.
Her eyelids were dropped like perfectly blank curtains,
robbing the face of its most essential expression. There was
a relaxed, earthy quality about the moulding of all the features,
such as even the most spiritual faces sometimes show
in sleep. As Jerome stood looking down at her, he was
afflicted in a breath with compassion and disgust. Poor Lili
looked so utterly and helplessly common: how had he ever
deceived himself to the extent of fancying he really loved
her? He remembered now with merely a feeling of cold
repugnance how naïvely he had begged her, in the old days,
to marry him. He judged and condemned himself, it is true,
from the standpoint of a subsequent development; but this
was a nicety which didn’t now enter into his scope of vision.
Jerome blamed Lili, but he also blamed himself; and it was
with entire frankness he realized his feeling for this woman,
nominally his wife, was a feeling of steadily entrenching
distaste.</p>

<p>What a strange and tragic predicament to have wriggled
into!</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>However, when the baby finally came, a new and very
wonderful experience developed for Jerome.</p>

<p>He had spent little thought beforehand on what it would
seem like to find himself a father. Now the fact rushed upon
him and unexpectedly overwhelmed him with its grandeur.</p>

<p>Jerome was a father!</p>

<p>Yes, the great miracle had happened to him. He was a
father. There was a baby boy, and the boy was his son. He
hadn’t realized what it would be like to have a son. Now
he knew, and the knowledge thrilled him—deeply. Jerome
remembered how the clerk from the tackle store had exulted
in his superb technique of casting, and how the fellow who
sold typewriters had talked about his great dream, architecture;
and he thought: “How very, very little all these things
are compared with having a son!” These things, only because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
he happened to think of them, and all things like them
on which men set their hearts. Even love. Yes, he thought,
even love was not quite in a class with having a son. Love
had come to him twice and failed. He was through with it
now. He had loved Stella; she had thrown him down and
married another man (how far away all that seemed!);
then he had loved Lili, and had come gradually to love her
no longer. But he was the father of Lili’s child.</p>

<p>He had a little son—and that, he told himself, was something
that would last! He had given up so much; but having
a son seemed to recompense for everything.</p>

<p>And indeed, for a time the child seemed to be drawing
Jerome and Lili a little together again. Lili had hated her
baby before it came; now she had it she responded to the
appeal of the little new life also. She had her glimmerings:
dim, errant aspirations toward something better in life
than she had known. Being a mother awakened what was
finest. When he saw the baby at her breast, Jerome looked
down at Lili with hopeful eyes. She had failed to hold his
love, but she was the baby’s mother; and love itself, he dimly
felt, might steal back somehow as time went on....</p>

<p>All these mighty and often quite overpowering emotions
transpired during the first two weeks of his august fatherhood.
When Jerome had been a father two weeks, he, together
with Lili and the baby and Xenophon Curry’s entire troupe
of songbirds, bade farewell to Melbourne and travelled back
to Sydney, the port where the first Australian engagement
had been played, and from which they were to embark.</p>

<p>It really was a joy to see the dear old <i>Skipping Goone</i>
once more. Some of the salutations of affection were perhaps
just touched with satire; but upon the whole the troupers had
settled into a state of romantic enthusiasm over this novel
style of beating about the world. Even Captain Bearman,
though he could scarcely be termed a popular favourite, was
made the recipient of cherry smiles and waves and nods.
The <i>Skipping Goone</i>’s master had voyaged to New Zealand
and back twice with mixed cargoes. Now they were off to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
New Guinea (merely a cargo call); and then would come
Manila.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Lili’s baby was the center of an enormous manifestation of
interest. Xenophon Curry was simply wild, and wanted to
do all sorts of reckless things with it from the very first.
Indeed, the impresario took such a violent and paternal interest
in the youngster that an outsider suddenly coming upon
a characteristic tableau would decide at once that the man
with the gay rings and the black toupee must be the baby’s
father—or at the very least its grandfather. One would
scarcely think, at first glance, of connecting Jerome with any
phase of immediate ownership. It only showed in his eyes.
If he took the baby up in his arms (which wasn’t very often)
he held it so awkwardly as to make every one laugh.</p>

<p>The tiny boy became the company mascot. “They say a
little baby often brings good luck,” observed the superstitious
impresario, his honest black eyes very shiny and serious.</p>

<p>And naturally, if the baby was to be the company mascot,
everybody in the company wanted to have a hand in the baby’s
affairs. All the women who knew how to handle a needle
at all began sewing every conceivable article of wardrobe
which could possibly fit an infant’s needs. No mother was
ever before so favoured!</p>

<p>Of course some of the garments turned out to be a little
queer, because opera singers aren’t necessarily authorities on
baby’s clothes. But a great deal of genuine affection and
good will was sewed into them—even the queerest.</p>

<p>The mascot was petted and pampered like a poodle. Its
host of admirers took turns holding it and walking with it
and talking baby-talk to it. In short, the mascot was treated
like a little king.</p>

<p>Naturally the parents were very proud. As for Lili, she
could never get over this most prodigious novelty. “I
just can’t believe it’s mine!” she would exclaim. Jerome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
felt much the same way; yet when he voiced the sentiment,
Lili, remembering that wretched little soldier in Honolulu,
would always look vaguely guilty. How did she know,
after all, whether the baby <em>did</em> belong to Jerome too?</p>

<p>However, of course no such dark uncertainties bothered
Jerome. His marriage could hardly be called better than
a failure. But at least, to him, this little son was a success.</p>

<p>He liked to drop down beside the cradle, his hands pressed
together between his knees, and just look. He couldn’t get
enough of just gazing, without saying anything at all.
Sometimes Lili would make fun of his silent devotion; she
took the baby a great deal more sensibly than Jerome did.</p>

<p>And yet, however sensibly, it was rather a fortunate thing
that there were so many eager and competing hands always
ready to relieve her of the burden of care; otherwise, it is
to be feared, the happy and beaming mother would too often
have felt bored and miserable, being so much tied down.
Dear Lili, though she really loved the baby, in her own happy-go-lucky
way, was never cut out to be a mother.</p>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Manila was reached without special incident.</p>

<p>As the <i>Skipping Goone</i> approached the harbour,
a sailing skiff was sighted making straight out for the
incoming schooner: a small pleasure craft with graceful lines,
which had won races in its day. When the skiff came closer
it was observed that some one aboard her was waving a handkerchief
in very earnest welcome: a woman, nodding and
smiling. With an abundant thrill, the impresario discovered
her to be Flora Utterbourne!</p>

<p>After the first shock of joyous surprise, Mr. Curry had a
curious feeling that it was somehow quite right and natural
to find her here in Manila, and to have her come out in a skiff
to meet him.</p>

<p>He wanted to climb right aboard the delightful skiff! He
seriously—or rather a little hysterically—consulted, even,
with Captain Bearman as to the practicability of such a
manœuvre, but received such a look of withering scorn as
to force him necessarily into a mood of resignation.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible to wait until the schooner came to
anchor. Yet by hook or crook the thing had to be managed.</p>

<p>The little craft skimmed and tacked about, like a playful
puppy barking at the heels of a charger, and often passed
so close as to permit of the single passenger’s engaging in
fragmentary talk with those aboard the larger vessel.</p>

<p>Curry went racing all over the <i>Skipping Goone</i> in a wholly
undignified fashion, seeking constantly shifting new points
of vantage from which interchanges would be most convenient.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
He puffed and perspired. He was enormously excited, and
made no attempt to conceal the interesting emotion. And
Flora was excited too, though even under this stress her
speech, as it came to him across the dazzling water, possessed
that flexible and gliding, that complex and ever smooth-flowing
quality, which he knew so well, with its quaint sprinkling,
too, of italicised and quoted words.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>He wanted to sit right down with her on the edge of the
wharf and talk.</p>

<p>“Do you realize it’s been the better part of a year since
Honolulu?”</p>

<p>“I <em>know</em>, my dear man, but we simply <em>can’t</em> sit down here in
all this ‘hubbub’!”</p>

<p>“There’s a carriage!” he cried; and he beckoned the driver
wildly.</p>

<p>She laughed—a little humorous, cordial, helpless laugh—and
he gave her his hand.</p>

<p>She entered the carriage and he climbed in after her with the
spring and zest of a stripling. It made him feel immensely
young to be with Flora again. He told her so, and she didn’t
mind anything he said, because she was feeling the very same
sensations herself. The impresario’s personal hand baggage
was bundled in with them, and they were off. The driver
wanted to know where to, but they said they didn’t care, so he
clucked to the horse and set out to circle the island. Such
opulent indefiniteness didn’t often befall.</p>

<p>It was an immortal ride. They talked themselves into almost
a state of eager hoarseness; and if one happened to break
in while the other was still speaking, the latter wouldn’t stop,
but would keep right on till the sentence was finished—never
stridently, yet with a vigour which refused to be downed. And
then, sometimes, they sat quite silent for a little while; but
somehow these pauses were just as thrilling as the talk itself.</p>

<p>The simplicity of what had at length developed into a real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
if somewhat unusual courtship was rather wonderful. There
was, underneath everything, just a fine mutual recognition of
compatibility. Flora wouldn’t have known how to be exactly
coy, even had she desired. So there was nothing quite of suspense
in their mellowing friendship. Both were so essentially
open and enthusiastic. She appreciated him and he appreciated
her. It had come about gradually and very simply,
and they just frankly recognized it. They <em>deserved</em> each other—yes,
that was it! And that was what kept humour so warmly
alive. She deserved him and he deserved her.</p>

<p>Flora told him, as they rode along, all the things she had
been doing since her last letter. There was a new apartment,
of course, in San Francisco—“quite a little snug one, this
time,” she said, “and not nearly so difficult to <em>furnish</em>, though
it’s a <em>charming</em> little place, and I’m trying out some brand new
‘colour schemes’ in it!”</p>

<p>And he told her all about the baby, and what an unusually
smart baby it was—really all but walking and talking, one
would swear, to hear the excited man rave! Flora laughed
till there were tears in her eyes; and she said she “<em>certainly</em>
must <em>see</em> the remarkable baby, which you say has become your
‘mascot’, though I don’t <em>really</em> see how a baby quite so <em>young</em>
could have teeth almost ready to break <em>through</em>!”</p>

<p>Then all at once it began to dawn on them that they didn’t
know in the least where they were driving to. They looked at
each other and laughed. And then they grew momentarily
rather solemn over a freely acknowledged state of famishment.
But scarcely had the wheels revolved a score of times when
they beheld—it was just like a page out of some fairy tale!—a
delightful house all overrun with crimson ramblers, and out
near the road a neat sign which said:</p>

<p class="center">MRS. GILFILLAN: PRIVATE BOARD.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” cried the driver, obedient to an exultant shout
from the impresario.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>“But do you think they would take us <em>in</em>, just for <em>lunch</em>?”
asked Flora. “For you <em>see</em> it isn’t really a <em>hotel</em>.”</p>

<p>“I know,” replied Mr. Curry confidently, “but it’s a canny
Scotch name, and I don’t think she’ll send us starving from her
door.”</p>

<p>And sure enough, she didn’t. Mrs. Gilfillan turned out to
be very corpulent, very Victorian, and very canny. She took
them right in, and they sat together at one end of a long table,
with all the fortunate private boarders; and there was a genuine
revolving pepper, salt, vinegar, and oil “caster” in the
centre of the table; and they ate preserves out of tiny saucers
of red glass with white scroll-work etched around the rims.</p>

<p>Mr. Curry leaned over and said in a low voice: “Did you ever
dream of finding a place like this in the Philippines?” And
Flora leaned over and replied, in her rich way: “<em>Isn’t</em> it the
most absurd and delightful place you ever <em>heard</em> of?”</p>

<p>The driver had his luncheon too, elsewhere on the premises,
and when the romantic couple emerged on to the porch they
found that he had piled Mr. Curry’s bags beside the front
door.</p>

<p>“Oh do <em>look</em>!” cried Flora.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! The fellow thought we’d decided to stop
here for good!”</p>

<p>“It’s <em>really</em> nice enough to ‘stop at’ for good, <em>isn’t</em> it?”
asked Flora, laughing a little, but showing by her tone, as
well as by a kind of wishing look in her eyes that she honestly
meant it.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>They stood humorously staring down at his things on the
doorstep.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed with a sigh, “it is nice. Lord, what
wouldn’t I give if there was nothing in the world left to do
but just settle down for good!”</p>

<p>Her brows were drawn quite earnestly. “How <em>often</em> lately
I’ve thought that <em>too</em>, though of course it’s hardly more than
a ‘snatch’ of impractical <em>dreaming</em>—isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose so,” he admitted, almost reluctantly. “It’s only
once in a while when you bump up against a place like this,
with roses climbing all over everything, and then—those bags
at the door.... Lord, doesn’t one get tired, sometimes, of
everlastingly hustling?”</p>

<p>“And yet,” she reminded him with a smile, “it’s the very
thing we have to <em>do</em>, isn’t it—<em>both</em> of us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the very thing.”</p>

<p>“It—it’s our <em>obstacle</em>!” Her eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>Then he asked, his voice grown warm and ardent: “Are we
going to let it be an obstacle always?”</p>

<p>“No, not <em>always</em>,” she replied, her own voice cordial and
eager and reassuring.</p>

<p>“How are we ever going to make the merry-go-round stop?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>some</em> way will open up, I <em>know</em>!”</p>

<p>They strolled out on to the lawn and sat down in a bona-fide,
old-fashioned, creaky garden swing.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose,” he suggested wistfully, giving her a most
enticing smile, “you ever take little flying trips into Africa?”</p>

<p>“Are you <em>determined</em> to go so far then?” she demanded,
with a playful, deprecating contraction of her brow.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I have to!” he told her, looking almost alarmed,
as though she were spreading for him a delicious snare which
he might find it impossible to resist. “We’re all advertised!
We open in Cape Town, and after that—Johannesburg.”</p>

<p>“Of course it would <em>never</em> do to leave out <em>Africa</em>,” she
assured him comfortingly. “And after all, you’ve only <em>begun</em>,
haven’t you, if it’s to be a real ‘world tour’?”</p>

<p>He held up a pleading hand and smiled. “It makes me a
little tired to look ahead so far!”</p>

<p>“But don’t you <em>remember</em> how you couldn’t <em>wait</em> to start
out in the <em>beginning</em>?”</p>

<p>The impresario bit off the end of a cigar and mused, his
words punctuated with spaces of lighting and taking the first
rapid puffs: “That was a long while ago, wasn’t it? I
thought nothing of such details as world tours then! Yet I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
truly believe the first feeling of the vastness of our terrestrial
ball came upon me—no, you’d laugh!”</p>

<p>“But you know I <em>never</em> laugh!” she reproached him,
laughing, her heart beating a little faster as she sensed the
trend of the talk.</p>

<p>“Well, then—the very day of the Hoadley auction!”</p>

<p>“<em>Really?</em> Yet you never knew how <em>impressed</em> I was with
it all, and what a great thing it seemed to <em>do</em>, though it <em>did</em> go
through my head, too, that ‘Singapore’ is—well, a pretty long
way <em>off</em>!”</p>

<p>“The place that really began giving me shivers of homesickness,”
he confessed, “was Cape <em>Horn</em>!”</p>

<p>There was a silence, and he was musing over her phrase:
“A way will open up.” A little later they drove back
through the quiet radiance of a tropical afternoon.</p>

<p>“I’m <em>afraid</em>,” she laughed deliciously, “your ‘songbirds’
will make up their minds I’ve carried you right off the
<em>island</em>!”</p>

<p>“You have,” he replied dreamily. “Off the island, and all
the way back to that snug apartment with the new colour
scheme, and we’re sitting together over our Sunday night
bowls of bread and milk, with the gate-legged table between
us....”</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes and slipped him one of her hands.
So one sees that the songbirds, when it came to that, would
really be not unjustified in their decision!</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">His small son had really begun to usurp his entire
horizon. Jerome was about the proudest father ever
seen. But the estrangement of Jerome and Lili came
to be a more or less openly recognized fact—which added a
sombre note.</p>

<p>Lili went about beaming in just the old, untroubled way.
Except when the baby was at her breast, one would never
dream of associating her with the supreme experience of
motherhood. Whatever might happen to her—and so much,
in her short life, had happened already—Lili would never be
any different.</p>

<p>With Jerome, however, the case stood otherwise. He
seemed slowly pulling ahead; but those great facts of life,
which made on him so enormous an impression, appealed to
Lili rather as episodes—objects to arrest a moment as one
flitted along through the vast lark of living.</p>

<p>As for the baby, it seemed to have fallen down very badly
indeed in the role of mediator; instead of feeling himself
drawn back to Lili again, Jerome appeared to have transferred
bodily all the love he had once known for her over to the
little new life that bore his name. How strangely things
moved! He tried to understand it, and felt that he really
understood so little.</p>

<p>It was delightful to see them together, Jerome and the
baby. He was still content, for the most part, just to gaze
down at the tiny fellow as he lay in the cheap little cradle
they had purchased in Australia. So entirely and even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
ludicrously undemonstrative was this attitude that the
troupers accused the proud father of being secretly afraid
of his offspring. Much more convincing, beams and all, was
the attitude of Lili, who, in her impetuous way, knew how
to make a fuss over a little bundle of flannel and lace as
successfully as over a man; so that the more conventional
picture of mother and child never failed to evoke an abundance
of enthusiastic appreciation.</p>

<p>“Look there—isn’t that sweet?” the touched impresario
would exclaim.</p>

<p>And everybody else thought so too. Even the comedian
was awed by the picture.</p>

<p>Everybody thought her a delightful mother. However, the
subtler picture was Jerome, a now responsible and experienced
man, sitting beside his baby’s cradle, looking down into
the tiny face as though he could never look enough, and
when no one was around, letting the fingers of a tiny hand
close about one of his fingers, thrust down so gently. And
once he cautiously stooped and kissed the baby, and felt a
thrill the like of which he had never known before in all
his life.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>At Manila where the <i>Skipping Goone</i> laid by three weeks,
it was learned that Captain Utterbourne had just been there
and departed. A few hours sooner, indeed, and they would
have encountered him.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it was he who had brought Flora
down and deposited her—with express understanding, however,
that she was to take a regular steamer home. “One
could hardly expect me to go into tourist traffic this late in
life, could one?” he asked sweetly, his cold lips moving with
dry mirth. And he delicately refrained from guessing the
romantic complexion of her sudden longing to visit Manila.</p>

<p>Yes, the <i>Star of Troy</i> was roving about somewhere in this
part of the world, and the intelligence seemed vaguely to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
upset the master of the <i>Skipping Goone</i>. A look of the
satellite came into his green eyes, and he felt somehow less
in control, even while he snarled the more convincingly and
had perhaps never looked so much like an admiral.</p>

<p>Manila was kind indeed to Mr. Curry and his songbirds,
and the engagement was by no means unprosperous. Then
they were under way once more, bound now for Borneo.
However, though brief, it was to prove a voyage more
packed with incident than any thus far.</p>

<p>The winds were mostly head winds, extremely variable,
and much time was lost. During one whole day the wind
dropped almost entirely, and rain poured down. The glass
ran low. The air was damp and unseasonably chilly, with
restless little gusts down the murk of the China sea. In the
midst of all this the baby managed to contract a cold.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a very bad cold, but since there was only one
baby, to say nothing of its being a mascot, instant alarm
ran through the schooner. Everybody was ready, quite
naturally and humanly, with every sort of suggested remedy.
Mr. Curry contributed a bottle of pine balsam; some one
else recommended camphor dropped on to a lump of sugar;
even smelling salts were advised. The principal topic of
conversation became the baby’s cold.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s nothing much,” said Lili. “He just snivels
a little.”</p>

<p>But Jerome was in a state of terrible anxiety. He, of them
all, had nothing to suggest by way of remedy; and yet it
seemed to him as though his very life depended upon the
baby’s recovery. They told him it was absurd to get into
such a state over a baby’s cold. “Just wait till the child
has measles and whooping cough before you begin to look so
solemn!” exclaimed the contralto, who knew what she was
talking about.</p>

<p>As the baby improved, Jerome was willing to listen to
reason. He had scarcely slept at night, though Lili had
taken it a great deal more sensibly. The baby’s cold was,
indeed, no great matter; but just as it was felt that there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
was no longer even a remote danger, a mysterious new combination
set in. Nobody seemed to be able to make it out.
Breathing grew laboured, and the pulse was so feeble that
they could barely find it.</p>

<p>Alarm returned. Jerome’s heart was again in a state of
panic, while Mr. Curry, in the privacy of his own little cabin,
spent a long time on his knees. “We couldn’t bear it!” he
murmured brokenly. “We just couldn’t bear it!”</p>

<p>Efforts were redoubled. They kept the baby wrapped up
in flannel. Then abruptly the cold disappeared entirely, and
the little creature grew so hot it seemed to burn one’s arms.
Each breath meant a sharp brief struggle. The day before
every one had felt so confident; today every one chilled to a
sense of hopelessness charged with foreboding.</p>

<p>The small sufferer struggled through a night and at dawn
ceased his convulsions. Jerome and Lili knew their baby
was dead even while last frantic efforts toward restoration
were being made.</p>

<p>The baby was dead, and the whole ship went into profound
mourning.</p>

<p>Lili cried like a little bewildered child. So her heart
was eased. But Jerome, at first, could do nothing but stare
down, stunned with misery, at the small lifeless form. When
Curry came upon him standing by the cradle, he drew an
impulsive arm about him; for the impresario seemed to understand
about these things better than anybody else.</p>

<p>“Courage, lad,” he said, tears splashing down, and his
great chest heaving. And Jerome could only falter, “Yes,”
in a groping way.</p>

<p>Jerome had loved the tiny boy with all his being. He had
laid long, silent plans; had seen the boy grow up; saw himself
even standing by Lili for the sake of the child. He
would love him more and more as the years went on. The
sense of warm devotion in Jerome’s heart had been almost
overpowering at times. But now the baby was gone, and the
dreams—they were gone too. It seemed almost like the end
of everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>The baby was buried at sea. One of the seamen, who
was clever with tools, made a smooth little casket, and the
small form was laid out in it, dressed in such finery as it
had acquired during the brief earthly sojourn. The contralto
who had had babies herself, in her time, offered some
very life-like artificial roses which she was accustomed to
wear in the <cite>Chimes of Normandy</cite>. The roses were pinned
at the waist of the little dress. Somebody muttered a fragment
of prayer, and the cover was fitted on.</p>

<p>Lili was sobbing hysterically, and Jerome stood near her,
his hands over his face.</p>

<p>It was a quiet night, with a few stars. The casket was
lowered gently in the dark. And the little mascot was gone
from them forever.</p>

<span class="smaller">WHOM THE POPPY CAPTURES</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Time stood still—or rather time crept forward like
a snail, and seemed unmoving. The hours of each
day stole on like the tide, slow, achingly slow; or
like a hill of sand which patiently sifts its way across a
pasture; or like a drowsy serpent in the sun. A week was
like a little lifetime. A month was like a cycle of Brahma.</p>

<p>Time, time, time! And overhead a sky of burning blue,
and all about a vacant sea, sleeping, dreaming, with just a
whisper of surf always on the yellow beach, marking the
hours into tiny rhythmic periods—innumerable and lethargic;
chiming like little shish-faint discs, like dainty cascades
of echoing silver; yet with ever a haunting prescience
of furious power behind, which sometimes broke out in
screaming tempest or long fierce hurricane.</p>

<p>Time, time, time! Here seemed eventlessness of a new
and sinister order. Values were subtly changing. Love
was a thing less sheer and unshakable. In a month—two
months—how all life seemed altered! One felt that invisibly
and silently, deep underneath the calm, there were mysterious
forces at work here on Hagen’s Island. Stella, as
time drew forward so slowly, found herself immersed in a
world of intangible agents. Nothing in her experience had
prepared her for this....</p>

<p>She had married a prince, and he had turned out to be
a White Kami. His empire was a tiny volcano tip in the
ocean. It was hither he had brought this bride of a so surprising
courtship. At first there had been only poppies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
and love. But now there was a pipe with a wee bowl, which
the White Kami had gradually learned to manipulate with
wonderful dexterity. Yes, at first his fingers were clumsy
and fumbling; there were times when he could not manage
the drop of opium: it would elude him, and he would chuckle
softly, or curse under his breath. But at length he had
grown marvelously proficient.</p>

<p>Opium! A terrible new doubt had torn its way into the
shadowy alarm of Stella’s soul. Opium—opium! How had
it come about? What did it mean? What might it end
by doing to both their lives?</p>

<p>Opium! Already, without her knowing it, Ferdinand
must have been steeping himself in the drug—perhaps from
almost the moment of their arrival. Just when <em>had</em> it begun,
she wondered darkly. Opium! Had he tried it first in just
a mood of adventurous experiment? And had it forced a
stronghold so insidious as not to be menaced—even by her
love for him?</p>

<p>In the light of that fierce, electric moment when she had
first beheld her husband stretched deep in the ecstasy of the
drug, Stella found herself reconstructing much that had
taken place preceding it: his growing lordliness and sometimes
almost wilful wish that the pathway of their love
should not lie smooth and charming; his fits of absorption,
that restless instability; his sullen insistence upon the operation
of his own caprice or will. Stella remembered with a
shudder how, while that pathetic little dinner lay stale and
untasted within, she had sat so long on the doorstep alone,
and how the dark, foreign night had seemed to press in upon
her and tinge her misery with aspects of stalking chaos. Yet
afterward, in the sunshine of a new day, and with the episode
of the untasted dinner behind them, Ferdinand had
tried to lighten the prospect with his bluff and reassuring
laugh.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re inclined to make mountains out of
mole-hills, lady-bird. Don’t you know that opium hasn’t
any ill effects at all unless taken in over-doses? Do you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
think a man’s a goner just because he happens to smoke a
mere pipeful of it now and then, by way of breaking in a
bit on this humdrum existence?”</p>

<p>“Ferdinand—” she faltered, half consciously relieved a
little, yet not, at heart, honestly convinced.</p>

<p>He interrupted her with a gesture half playful, half of
impatience. “I know what I’m about, peaches. We’ll just
forget it.”</p>

<p>Oh life! Oh, the forces of life—and the world—and
human destiny!</p>

<p>But, though Stella strove to forget, she couldn’t quite succeed,
and felt herself falling more and more prey, as time
crept on, to doubt and foreboding. Opium! It began to
strike on her ears like such words as cobra, shark, and scorpion.
It had a reptilian, a vicious, loathsome sound. And
she grew sick at heart and terrified. A barrier seemed rising
stealthily between them—between her heart and all the
radiant happiness which had glorified its dreams. Love
merged with fear and became sorely baffled. Life was beset
with groping.</p>

<p>At last it had come to July. Six leaves were gone from the
calendar, and midway across the leaf which would next stand
uncovered, was the date set by Captain Utterbourne as
possibly marking his first return to the island. August the
fifteenth! Stella had put in a background of red, so that
the figures stood out crisply. Yet of course she knew it
might not be just on that day. It might be any day during
the week succeeding.</p>

<p>“Or maybe he’ll come as early as the <em>eighth</em>,” she told herself,
a pang of terrible hope breaking across her heart at the
mere conjecture. But there were times when, as with a faint
breath of foreboding, she strove desperately not to kindle
false lights in her heart; then she would muse: “Perhaps
not before the twenty-second.... I mustn’t let myself grow
too impatient.” Once—grimly: “What if the time goes by
altogether? What then?” Why, then it would simply mean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
that the <i>Star of Troy</i> need not be looked for until the completion
of the year—not before February. “But I can’t
stand it,” she cried tensely, “unless he comes next month!
I can’t any longer, with things as they are....” She trembled,
feeling her brow grow cold and wet.</p>

<p>For King’s downward progress had been darkly alarming;
and out of all that beauty and delight of her release, a new
relentless doom seemed creeping.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>King had begun to eat it, she knew, as well as smoke it.
His appetite had rapidly developed to ghastly proportions.</p>

<p>She saw, with awful vividness, daily before her eyes, the
potency of this drug which her husband had come here to
handle, and upon which the prosperity of their future was to
rest. She saw its fiendishness, its strange compelling charm.
He had laughed at first. “Don’t you worry, little girl,” he
used to say. “I know enough to keep an upper hand.” Was
this an upper hand?</p>

<p>“You think the stuff’s getting hold of me, don’t you?” he
chaffed one breathless June evening; and Stella, though she
was determined not to give way, could not restrain a desperate
gesture. After a little silence King laughed reassuringly;
and then, with a fling of his head he said: “I’m not
used to this sort of life, little girl, and sometimes it gets my
goat!”</p>

<p>Another evening he strode heavily over to her and grasped
her arms with considerable vigour. “It’s time you stopped
all this mooning and sighing, I think,” he told her thickly,
an indefinite dash even of menace in his tone. “I’ve been
watching you. It’s all nonsense, and I won’t have it! You
understand? I know what you think. You think I couldn’t
stop, right off in a minute, if I wanted to. Well, I could.
Some day, just for fun, I’ll show you. Let’s have no more
foolishness. I know what I’m doing. I’ve lived in the world
a good many years, little girl, and I ought to know by this
time how to look after myself. I don’t like your mournful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
eyes and your tears. I tell you I don’t like them. You act
like an everlasting funeral!”</p>

<p>His words gave slightly the impression that he was striving
to carry a point in his own mind, somewhat, as well as
in his wife’s. Later, off by himself in another part of the
house, she heard him laugh again, a loud laugh, with just a
note in it of new and sinister wildness.</p>

<p>Sometimes his round blue eyes seemed to bore into her
with a searching, challenging look. She felt her soul in
commotion. And she said nothing, only watched the slow
change in those eyes, as hunger stole into them. Slowly her
heart chilled with a sense of doom.</p>

<p>These were restless and not very happy days on Hagen’s
Island, though in most respects life went on quite as usual.
King seemed anxious to plunge more strenuously than ever
into the work. A heavy grimness sometimes coloured his
attitude. He grew vaguely harassed and more palpably
restive. Faint lines of struggle crept into his face. He
laughed more boisterously, though perhaps rather less often.</p>

<p>There were times when Stella felt herself slipping
tragically out of his life; yet he still found obvious pleasure
in having her come to meet him on his return from the fields,
and often delighted her with flashes of the old intimate tenderness.
But there were occasions, too, when he displayed
such an enlarged arrogance, and chaffed with such an edge
that she trembled and felt her soul in still greater commotion.
For he could less and less, as the time went on, endure
any suggestion that things weren’t quite well with him.
If he saw her in tears it would make him furious. Sometimes
a rebuke or sharp gesture of impatience would rouse her
heart, and she would rebel against the docility which, on
her side, had always seemed an essential feature of the
romantic relationship. Then perhaps there would come a
mutual wave of affection and forgiveness, and peace would
inhabit the house. He would call her “little lady,” and
sometimes he still called her “peaches,” though his moods
of softness appeared somewhat less frequent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>As time went on and her husband seemed falling more
and more under the insidious sway of the drug, doubts
stirred more and more, also, in Stella’s heart. And she began
to ask herself questions about the future which she could
not answer, and which often filled her with a nameless
terror.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the evening Stella would watch her husband,
fascinated by the fearful process of opium smoking, as she
had once been fascinated by the sheer dazzle of his eyes and
the romance of manners such as she had never dared hope
to encounter outside of books. She would sit, almost spellbound,
and see the resistless hunger take possession of him.
Perhaps he would be working away on his report for Captain
Utterbourne; but at length he would fling himself upon the
cot. He would scowl at her with eyes which showed a dull
glow of something ominous; then his hands would go out
to the tabouret, and with fingers no longer altogether steady,
but which had taken on of late a curious flutter, he would
seize the pipe. After that, absorption would claim him
utterly, as though he inhabited a separate universe.</p>

<p>He would draw a large drop of opium, twirl it on the
point of the dipper, round and round, with uncanny deftness,
over the flame of the spirit lamp, hold it there like meat on
a skewer till it roasted. He had learned to an exquisite
fineness when the tiny browning ball was cooked to the
proper pitch—never the least bit burned, never toasted a shade
too dry, yet never drawn off underdone, either. Occasionally
he would bring the opium away from the flame and roll it
gently on the bowl of his pipe. At last he would hold
the pipe itself over the flame a moment, and then would
quickly thrust the laden end of the dipper into the bowl,
just over the orifice—always sure, with fluttering fingers;
always uncannily sure. Then he would relax. And there
he would lie, a spectacle of manhood in the wrecking, the
stem of the pipe between his lips, which had taken on a
bloated look and seemed no longer quite the cupid’s bow of
old. The pipe would sway slowly back and forth, trembling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
a little over the fire of the spirit lamp. And as the sphere
of drug inside the bowl began to sizzle, the White Kami,
who had once been Ferdinand King, that figure extraordinary
of beauty and romance, would draw in with all the fervour
of his captured soul; and the spent smoke would drift in
clouds from mouth and quivering nostrils.</p>

<p>She brooded it with a breaking heart when he was away
from her; when he returned she looked at him with eyes
full of fear and disillusion. Gradually—and there was time
to do full justice to every faintest shade of thought and feeling
here—she came to doubt in her heart whether the dreams
she had dreamed would ever come true. During these endless
hours and days and months with their silence and their
augmenting thrill of terror, she came to feel that it was all
too late—too wretchedly, tragically late.</p>

<p>Stella had been happy, she remembered with a pang, at
first—a little feverishly, perhaps, even at best, though still
undoubtedly happy. The voyage and the first weeks here
on the island had been like some lovely dream, with only
vague, uncharted doubts and tremors of uneasy fancy....</p>

<p>Now her whole life seemed suddenly uncharted.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>The opium “factory” stood just at the edge of the Ainu
village: a mere palm-thatched shed, with rafters strung along
inside, from some of which double bags of sheeting were
suspended. The bags contained the crude drug or “chick,”
which had been standing in linseed oil to prevent evaporation,
and which was now in process of being drained dry. A
basin underneath each bag received the oily residue; but the
bags had been hanging there a good while, and the drippings
were only occasional. In one corner was a vat, half full of
a sluggish dark substance which several Ainu women were
patiently kneading with bare feet. Tsuda stood watching
them, critical, keen-eyed.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. King came in. He glanced about sharply,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
frowned, sniffed. Tsuda reluctantly dropped on to one knee,
while the labourers prostrated themselves, awaiting a sign
from the White Kami which would signify to them that they
might resume their work. King waved an impatient arm,
then moved about restlessly, it almost seemed a bit aimlessly,
inspecting the premises.</p>

<p>His whole bearing appeared somewhat altered. The lordliness,
if anything, was exaggerated, at the same time that
he impressed one as being subtly less in control. Certainly
he was noticeably thinner; his former look of florid fulness
was giving place to a muddy pallor, tending to make
his eyes somewhat sunken. Tsuda flashed a glance at him,
then looked doggedly back at the ground.</p>

<p>King approached the vat and investigated with one finger
the consistency of the opium.</p>

<p>“It will soon be tough enough,” he muttered; while Tsuda
kept a smile under judicious control. The overseer cleansed
his finger slowly and meticulously on a cloth, studied his
nails a moment with knit brow, drew out his little notebook
and held a pencil poised above one page a long time;
finally with a detached sigh he put it back into his pocket
without having recorded anything at all. He looked about
him, his round blue eyes staring, then strode abruptly out of
the shed. Tsuda gazed after him with a yellowish light in
his complex Asiatic face.</p>

<p>A moment later a young savage named Nipek-kem ran in.
He had been chosen, because of superior attainments, as
Tsuda’s special aid and lieutenant—a convenient go-between
and secret informer. Out of breath, he was now the bearer
of tidings: the man whose wife had buried the head-dress was
dead.</p>

<p>“I expected it,” said Tsuda dryly.</p>

<p>Nipek-kem elaborated: When the man learned his wife had
prayed the curse against him, he raised his arm to strike her
dead; but it was already long that the symbol lay under
ground, and his arm dropped; he could not lift it any more.</p>

<p>For a moment Tsuda’s eyes gleamed. It was a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
miracle, and the priest in him would never die. For an instant
the worldly side seemed crowded out, and he saw
himself in the sacerdotal robes, in a temple all a-murmur with
the breath of the eternal gods. But the vision passed. With
a sudden cry, as actuated by some swift inner flash, Tsuda
seized the fellow’s arm. He brought his lips close and murmured,
trembling with an excitement of new purpose:</p>

<p>“You know the place in the rocks where the Wife-of-the-Kami
sits much of late?”</p>

<p>Nipek-kem raised both hands to his chest, letting them wave
gracefully downward. Yes, he knew.</p>

<p>“Go and see if she is there now, and come back quickly.”</p>

<p>The savage sped off.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Tsuda sat down beside the opium vat,
a look of devious tenderness in his face.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Nipek-kem peered cautiously over a ledge of rock, all his
movements stealthy. Below, with her head thrown back,
sat the wife of the White Kami. Her eyes were closed; she
appeared to be sleeping. The Ainu gazed down at her a
moment, then crept silently backward and disappeared.</p>

<p>When Stella opened her eyes she started and cried out a
little. Tsuda was squatting near her, looking very mild and
child-like.</p>

<p>“You come here often,” he murmured humbly.</p>

<p>“Every day,” she replied. “I come to watch for ships
that might pass by—just to see them—it wouldn’t matter
how far off....”</p>

<p>The girl seemed changed; her eyes had a strained look,
and she appeared drawn to a perpetual tension of nervous
expectancy; she had aged a little; there was a new calm
about her, too—it was dimly menacing....</p>

<p>King’s revolver lay beside her on the rock. One night she
had a faintly disquieting dream about the Ainu, and seeing
her husband’s revolver with some of his things next day,
she decided to carry it with her on her solitary vigils. However,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
she carried it, really, not so much for protection as
because it was a weapon with which she could attack the
silence, when it grew too awful to be endured, as King had
attacked it the day he returned home from his first inspection
of the fields.</p>

<p>“You will see no ships go by,” said Tsuda with an emphatic
shake of his long head. “Ships don’t leave the course unless
they have to—no, <em>sir</em>!” He had heard Captain Utterbourne
explain it—a law of least resistance in ships.</p>

<p>“Are the nearest sailing lanes a long way off?” asked the
girl with a trembling touch of wistfulness in her voice.</p>

<p>Things weren’t going very well on Hagen’s Island. Illusions
were rubbing threadbare. It was a time for spiritual
inventories.</p>

<p>“Long way—I should say! Full day steaming head on,
mebby more.” There was evidence here of a slight nautical
confusion, though he always paid the closest attention, too,
whenever Utterbourne opened his lips. “Better to give up
look for ships—gn—that don’t ever come,” Tsuda murmured,
his eyes searchingly upon her face.</p>

<p>She looked at him sadly, and he let his gaze fall to the little
gleaming weapon at her side. Presently he lifted his eyes to
hers, and, with a child-like smile, pointed to the revolver.</p>

<p>“It is very pretty,” he said. “I had a fine one, once—a
fellow give me in Benares. But”—he grew a shade petulant—“the
Captain wouldn’t let me keep it—say one gun on the
island was enough.” And in a moment he added, speaking
more simply and smiling in his naïve way: “Will you let me
take it in my hand, Wife-of-the-Kami?”</p>

<p>Her lips moved—it was a tiny ghost-smile. “Yes,” she said.</p>

<p>Tsuda took the revolver into his hand, his face quite radiant.
Anything new—anything he didn’t possess.... He
examined it minutely and lovingly.</p>

<p>“Do you mind if I shoot?” he coaxed.</p>

<p>“There’s a little patch of white against the rocks, far down
there near the water,” she told him, a vague touch of interest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
coming for a moment into her listless voice. “I use it sometimes
as a target.”</p>

<p>“Will you show me?” He crept to her side very humbly.
She saw that his hand was a little unsteady.</p>

<p>Tsuda emptied the revolver quickly and deftly, then handed
it back to her with a faint regretful smile. And he said,
softly, his eyes agleam as he spoke, in a cryptic whisper:</p>

<p>“Your husband is a very lucky man, Wife-of-the-Kami....”</p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>Returning from his cursory inspection of the opium vat,
King entered a silent house. He had turned one room into
a makeshift office; for it had become his practice to divide
his time between fields and desk. He liked to point out
that the principal difference between his job and Tsuda’s was
that the former called for head work.</p>

<p>King did rather a good deal of figuring and scribbling.
Until recently the report had gone along in fine style. It was
full of notes and queries and memos of many sorts, and
bristled with little tentative schemes, sometimes inclined toward
extravagance, for bringing water into the fields during
the dry spells. He was also working on percentages of dross,
which might be cut down to the benefit of the more special
product. A little of the output was prepared after an elaborate
Bengal receipt for special trade. Utterbourne disposed
of the major part to Indian agents; the rest disappeared along
coasts from which fishing smacks came plying with devious
credentials. These were transactions that would not bear any
very merciless investigation, perhaps, though they were frequently
more remunerative than the regular trade.</p>

<p>King, in role of overseer and general manager, had really
gone at it all rather intelligently, to begin with. The island
was a test, and he intended to make good. However, the business
was lagging of late.</p>

<p>Stella, coming in, found her husband sitting at his work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
table, his head fallen down on to his arms. Yet he was not
asleep, for his eyes were wide open, staring into space with
an almost frantic look.</p>

<p>It seemed to her—came rushing upon her in a romantic
wave—that this was a climax. She ran up to him with a little
desperate cry, held his face in her hands—a real flash of
passion; she felt suddenly the stronger of the two—almost as
though he were coming to depend upon her now.... And
she resolutely fought down a vague impulse of shrinking
which his altering presence sometimes aroused.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>He brought himself round with an effort that beaded his
forehead with a few drops of cold sweat. His look darkened—it
was as though he divined what was in her mind.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” he muttered thickly. “What do you want to interrupt
me for? I’ve told you I can’t be bothered when I’m
in here, damn it!”</p>

<p>“But Ferd....” She felt the climax slipping.</p>

<p>“Go on about your work and leave me alone. I’m trying
... I say, I’m trying to work out a better product for
our special trade.”</p>

<p>The effort it took to destroy the illusion in his wife’s mind
was so terrific that it left him shaking. He spoke almost savagely;
he was in a savage frame of mind, for he had overrun
his usual hour for indulgence in drug, and was trying to persuade
himself that he was still in control. The compassionate
attitude she had taken could hardly have been more unhappily
timed.</p>

<p>Stella, perceiving the failure of her little desperate move,
slipped away, her heart troubled with a strange conflict of
emotions. He had not, despite his agonizing effort, strengthened
her crumbling confidence in him.</p>

<p>And she knew with a pang that he had not really been
working on the product for the special trade at all.</p>

<span class="smaller">BITTER COMFORT</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The former delight of their life together was frequently
turned to bitterness by just such disillusionizing scenes
as this. The time had long passed when she could
please and amuse and occasionally puzzle him with her romancing,
her manifest infatuation. King seemed unable to
grasp or tolerate such things as romance any more. Sometimes,
indeed, he would go for days without more than
casually recognizing her mere presence in the house. Again,
a mood of tenderness would come upon him and she would
see that his eyes glistened with tears. The sense of mirage
would be strong in her heart, for Stella was growing wary;
yet even so, it would seem, at such times, as though a little
light were breaking along the path ahead of them. But it
couldn’t last—and she was never really fooled.</p>

<p>Sometimes her husband’s eyes would even take on their old
look of roundness and fascination, and, as though psychically
stirred by the unuttered anguish within her, he would go on
in the old way, laying extravagant plans—all the things they
would do by and bye: the places they would visit, the brilliant
life they’d live. But she felt him, to employ metaphor,
puffing, a little, always, at such times, like a half spent runner,
in an effort to make spontaneous what had lost the persuasive
ring of spontaneity. Also, she made the discovery, after a
while, that King only reverted to these flashes of the old-time
splendour when an opium mood reined most benignly
in his heart—a heart, after all, mysterious still, and unsearchable
as the forces Stella felt at work all about her in this
little empire of the poppy.</p>

<p>She grew bold and fearless in a new determination to tear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
away all the films from her own vision and face the naked
facts of her life, whatever they might prove.</p>

<p>“It’s a queer thing,” she mused, “that there weren’t any
premonitions of all this in the old days....” But then she
remembered how her father had been so troubled and swayed
with doubt at first: how he had held her close and asked:
“Are you sure, girlie—<em>dead</em> sure?” Yes, there had been that
note—she lingered over it almost caressingly. And then those
words of Elsa’s: “Don’t you hold on so hard to your ideals,
Stella,” or however she had phrased it—yes, they, too had a
haunting way of returning. “But what were my ideals?” she
asked herself searchingly. “Did I have any? What was it
I thought I wanted? What was I so eager to grasp, after
all?”</p>

<p>She had played, as it had seemed to her, so brilliantly.
He had fanned her at the ball as though she were a princess.
He had sent her violets and taken her to the matinée. Then
their lives had intertwined, and they had married. She had
been so eager to thrust her destiny into his hands. She
had run neck and neck with glittering Irmengarde....</p>

<p>“Irmengarde!” she muttered. “Only think of it!”</p>

<p>Now the pace had retarded. How far back all that seemed!
How little she had understood life; how little she had understood
her own heart. Time stood drowsy and stagnant, and
her prince was tampering with a dread elixir. Yes, the gay,
magnetic prince, with white at either temple, who had murmured
so enchantingly in the long-ago: “Curly Locks, Curly
Locks, wilt thou be mine?”</p>

<p>“What I fell in love with must have been nothing more
than a myth, I guess,” she faltered. For time and silence
were bringing her to deep and pitiless introspection. She had
been just in the mood ... he had set her young girl fancy
afire. But adversity was turning her into a woman, and
she knew what it was to drink from a very bitter cup indeed.</p>

<p>Love flew out of the window. But the awful reality of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
Hagen’s Island could not be dispelled. Her dreams all glimmered
out, too. But her husband remained, like a heavy
dross of fact. With the shine gone, she was no longer blinded.
There was bitter comfort in this.</p>

<p>If she still pleaded with him, it was no longer like a
frightened doll. It might not, somehow, be too late, even
now, she sometimes groped, if the Captain.... But time
would mock her with its everlasting patience. “What a
strange thing life is,” she mused.</p>

<p>One day she grasped his hands and gripped them tight.
“Let me throw the stuff into the sea,” she urged. “Give me
the pipe and all the things you use, and try....” But she
could not, after all, quite face the look in his eyes without
faltering, even though she had learned to speak so simply,
from her heart.</p>

<p>“God help me!” he muttered brokenly. It sounded like a
terrible amen in some ironic ritual of praise.</p>

<p>She braced herself with an immense effort of will, met his
gaze again, and went on earnestly: “I’ll help you with the
work—we’ll try to make a success of the island together, since
the island has to be.” Yes, adversity was making a woman
of her after its own inexorable pattern, and she was no longer
hoodwinked by that curious superstition about a woman’s
fingers and a man’s work....</p>

<p>On the point of reminding him of the fine things they had so
often planned to do, a quite wonderful half inspired impulse
came to her, and she said: “I’ve heard you speak many times
of wanting to settle down somewhere in a cheerful little
flat without bothering much if nothing ever happened. It
used to seem to me as though I couldn’t endure a life like that;
but now it’s really all the same to me. If you’d rather live
that kind of a life, then it will suit me too, I guess. Anything
you can fix your mind on strong enough, so you....”</p>

<p>In spite of everything, her words sounded a little hollow to
her. Yet back of them was such burning sincerity, too; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
she felt that she couldn’t go on living at all, after this, if he
patted her head and laughed, or if he said: “Don’t worry,
little girl!”</p>

<p>He did not laugh, but clung to her—even frantically. He
gazed at his wife with wild, brimming eyes, and caressed her
hair with gentle trembling fingers. He pressed her passionately
against his heart, and with a shaking voice he murmured:
“I swear—I swear to you....” There seemed a faint
cloud of exaltation about them.</p>

<p>But at evening she saw him again relaxed and ravenous,
twirling the little fatal drop above the flame of the spirit lamp.
And she saw that it was all irrevocable. And she saw how
hopeless it all was....</p>

<span class="smaller">RENDEZVOUS</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">The visit of the old chief, though informally handled,
was a really quite momentous affair.</p>

<p>Cha-cha-kamui (English version: Very-Old-and-Very-Wonderful)
had dressed up in his robe of state, a most gaudy
creation of red and white cloth. He wore a great crown made
of cocoanut palm shavings and embellished with beautiful
gilt paper and wild cotton. The crown was necessarily a
great one, because Cha-cha-kamui possessed a head of enormous
dimensions—truly quite the head of some mythical though
very mild and somewhat fussy old giant. His hair was getting
pretty thin on top—the Ainu were sadly on the toboggan.
The crown, therefore, performed a two-fold service.</p>

<p>It was a state affair. King received his august visitor in
the “parlour,” where he spent a good deal of time these days.
Tsuda, as he entered, sniffed the air, and his eyes glittered
subtly.</p>

<p>As for Cha-cha-kamui, he was shaking all over from sheer
excitement. He had never been in the immediate presence
of a kami before. He was a great chief, and had brought his
people down here inside a whale; he was close to the gods,
but was not himself a god. Thus the ordeal was considerable,
and he was glad to squat as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The longer the old chief stayed, however, the more his
nervousness fell away from him—especially after King had
brought out some of the excellent brandy that had come all
the way from San Francisco. He smacked his lips over it in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
touching appreciation. It was a great deal better than Tsuda’s
saké. Tsuda would have to look to his laurels!</p>

<p>Cha-cha-kamui gazed at King, his old eyes lit with affectionate
devotion. He wrinkled his eyelids until he could hardly see,
and lifted up the corners of his mouth with such vigour that
he lifted his cheeks right along with them. He fawned. He
massaged his aged hands, and made his scalp wiggle back and
forth. It was a spectacle!</p>

<p>And then, obedient to a private signal from Tsuda, the old
man came to the real business of the session. He launched
out fervently upon a long and very confidential speech, which
Tsuda, feigning some surprise and displaying touches of
modest delicacy here and there, translated into English of
his usual colloquial and even slangy sort: English that was
sly and shrewd and not a little waggish.</p>

<p>As for the speech itself—well, it was all about Cha-cha-kamui’s
wives; and since the Great Wife must naturally go
right on enjoying the high prestige of a position bestowed for
life, and since she couldn’t be expected to retain in full vigour
the charms of her now far distant youth, there was nothing
to prevent a little harmless alliance on the side; and what
Cha-cha-kamui had above all come to tell the White Kami
was that he wanted the White Kami to have his Small Wife
for his very own. The theme rose to heights of eloquence;
it became an oration; he had never in all his life tasted anything
half so fine as the brandy from San Francisco. He
wanted the White Kami to take his Small Wife; he wanted to
show his homage—and could mortal man give more?</p>

<p>The speech amazed King greatly. It was, in truth, an
amazing speech. King hardly knew how to take it at first,
and looked at Tsuda in a complex, searching way. But presently
he laughed, with a laugh that had a sort of catch or
rattle in it; and he thanked the royal octogenarian and replied
much as he had once replied to Tsuda respecting another
issue: “You’re very kind. Perhaps I’ll avail myself of your
generosity one of these days—who knows?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>Yes—who knew? He had been used to a life of movement
and diversion, and Hagen’s Island was a little remote. He
felt broken and reckless. Often he longed to fall back into
old voluptuous ways. Yes, who knew? He had fallen so
far; let all the old passions rush and confound his soul. Besides,
ever since the day Stella had pleaded with him so earnestly,
and he had crumpled and wept and murmured: “God
help me!” King had had a feeling that he was no longer
master. He had shown her a weakness which put him, however
intangibly, in her power. Often a muddy desire came
upon him to reassert his manhood and resume full moral
sway. The very episode which at the time had seemed drawing
them closer together had in reality plunged them farther
apart.</p>

<p>He argued weakly and gropingly. His soul snarled for
opium.</p>

<p>Cha-cha-kamui departed well pleased, and marched proudly
back to the village. His crown was a trifle awry, and perhaps
he walked a little unsteadily; but no one could expect
to emerge from the presence of the gods behaving quite as
usual.</p>

<p>Tsuda, also, departed well pleased.</p>

<p>Left alone, King stood a few moments, irresolute, his mind
carrying on the argument it had been engaged with, but in
a more and more febrile fashion. Yes, he groped, perhaps
this maiden of the old chief’s could give him back the sense
of supremacy which had so lapsed and failed of late.
Stella.... He rambled darkly. She had grown too strong
for him ... he scarcely knew her any more. Then he
laughed again, a reckless, unnerved laugh; and there was a
hollowness in it, and a catch; it slyly rattled.</p>

<p>King’s mind, at the time of the old chief’s arrival, had been
morbidly clear, as it always was when under an immediate
spell of narcotic. Opium never muddled him, but on the
contrary stimulated his faculties, set them in exquisite if
sombre harmony. But when the hunger for more swept upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
him, then a cloud seemed to descend, and he saw all things
darkly.</p>

<p>The house was full of an immense stillness. He had a
sense of wavering all alone in space. After a moment he
slunk to his cot and lay down. A heaviness like the pain of
a nameless, black remorse, beat dully at his pulses. There
was no longer within him even the power to struggle. He
was shadowed by nightmare, cursed with impotence of will,
chained down by a fatal languor and could only move in the
direction dictated by drug. Reaching out for the little spirit
lamp, he lighted it. His eyes gleamed with eagerness and
torture. As the tiny sphere of ecstasy sizzled and browned
over the flame, he longed with a terrible longing to be free
once more even while he knew that to be free would cost an
effort such as he had not any longer the moral courage to
make.</p>

<p>He drew in deeply and expelled the vapour with a long
sigh of delight. Almost in an instant he was a prince again,
and the empires of the earth and of the skies were his.</p>

<p>The island was a test. However, he was busy with other
harvests now.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Time, silence, the sea. And through them thrilled ever that
haunting sense of something just impending. The island was
like a room in which there was only so much air. When
the air was gone, that would be the end. However, it was
all very elusive and subtle.</p>

<p>The slow days crept like the imperceptible movement of
shade across a sweep of summer lawn.</p>

<p>One morning, soon after dawn came in across the dreamy
jungle, Stella stood before the calendar blocking out her
yesterday. There was a look of quivering, almost frantic
hope in her eyes. Today was the long awaited fifteenth of
August, and she meant to spend it all in her rocky nook,
gazing to sea through the glasses. Perhaps there would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
a tiny speck at last on the horizon. Captain Utterbourne was
a man quite capable of being perversely and poetically
punctual if he chose.</p>

<p>Mechanically she loaded her pistol and took the binoculars.
Who but the Captain would ever think of anything so beautifully
and maddeningly ironical for a wedding gift?</p>

<p>On the way out she noticed in passing that her husband
wasn’t in the parlour where he usually slept now, so as to be
near his smoking materials.</p>

<p>On the floor in a corner, half buried beneath trash, lay the
big book in which King’s report on the progress of opium
culture was to have appeared. Life seemed slipping out between
his fingers. He could not have told just when he
crossed over the sinister boundary beyond which there could
be no returning. However, he had passed it by, and now
could only press on and on.</p>

<p>This morning the sun was barely in the sky, yet King was
not in the house. Dully she wondered where he was. Then
she passed on out into the early freshness of the dawn.</p>

<p>At first the sea was misty. But as the day advanced a
little, and the shroud gradually dissolved, it became very blue—like
the colour in certain canvases of primitive Italian
painters.</p>

<p>Tsuda came toward her, hat in hand, and his demeanour,
as always, scrupulously humble. Sometimes she felt Tsuda
was too humble; yet she believed he had the heart of a child.
Tsuda could scarcely be thought of as in any sense a kindred
soul; they were not of the same race; and at times he alarmed
her, vaguely, with his flashes of oriental mysticism; still,
after a fashion, he spoke her tongue, and beside him and her
husband there were only the hairy Ainu....</p>

<p>Tsuda greeted her cheerfully and with his usual wide-eyed
innocence in full operation.</p>

<p>“Wife-of-the-Kami, you come early today.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she told him quietly. “I am looking for the <i>Star of
Troy</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>“The <i>Star of Troy</i>?” There was a flash almost of sudden
dismay in his bright eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s not certain,” she admitted wistfully.</p>

<p>“Wife-of-the-Kami, he will not come today.”</p>

<p>She turned her eyes, so full of sorrow and of disillusion,
upon him. “Why do you say that, Tsuda?”</p>

<p>“We must—gn—wait out the year. It is always so. He
will not come today, Wife-of-the-Kami.”</p>

<p>Her eyes travelled away from his face dully and rested on
the sea again—the sunny, vacant sea. She felt that her heart
was very close to breaking.</p>

<p>When at last her arms tingled with the strain of holding
up the binoculars, she lowered them slowly. And then she
saw that the young savage, Nipek-kem, had slipped noiselessly
toward them and had prostrated himself before her.</p>

<p>“Please tell him he may get up,” she said.</p>

<p>Then Tsuda, who, she saw, had likewise dropped to his own
slightly rheumatic knees, spoke a few low words to Nipek-kem,
who promptly arose and sat on the ground Turk-fashion, beginning
at once an elaborate Ainu gesture salutation. Every
movement of his body lured a tiny jingle from the accoutrements
of his royal-looking shirt-front. Finally he lifted up
his hands as high as his head, the palms turned upward, and
lowered them gradually to his knees, speaking at the same time
a few murmuring words in the crude Ainu dialect.</p>

<p>“What does he want?” asked Stella.</p>

<p>“He tell—gn—of a prayer in the valley for rain. It is long
time, Wife-of-the-Kami, that we get no rain, and the cocoanut
withers in the sun. They ask if you will show yourself on
the crest of the hill as a sign—gn—the gods will open up
the sky.”</p>

<p>She felt the primitive fog of superstition in the midst of
which she dwelt, and a shudder of new misgiving and vague
fear oppressed her. But she rose and said: “Yes, I will go.
Where is the hill, Tsuda?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>“Just come along this way, Wife-of-the-Kami. I give you
a hand so you don’t slip down where it get steep.”</p>

<p>And Nipek-kem followed at a respectful distance. But
first, his eyes agleam, he picked up the little revolver which
Stella had left on the rock. He slipped it inside his tunic
of birds’ feathers. This, he knew with a gay heart, would
mean all the good saké he could drink.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>The hill to which Tsuda took her, his hand hot, trembling
now and then a little as it supported her up the rough trail,
proved to be the same hill upon which reposed the prostrate
slab sacred to the remains of Vander Hagen. It was one of
the loftiest spots on the island. They stood just beside the
grave to watch the rain ceremonial.</p>

<p>In the valley below were a few Ainu huts. In their midst
was a bit of open sward, and half the tribe was assembled.
Most of the Ainu lay on the ground and kept nodding their
heads in the dust in a patient, abject way. In the centre of the
sward a post had been set up, and upon it was fastened the dilapidated
skull of a raccoon brought down from Paromushir.
It seemed to leer in the sunshine. There was no cloud in
the sky. The island simmered and baked. This was, indeed,
an unusual spell of drought in a realm so lush, and where
scarcely a day passed by without its brief, warm drenching. In
the valley they prayed for rain, and some capered solemnly,
sprinkling each other with water. Nobody remembered at
length how the curious custom had begun. Its origin lay
swallowed up in the void that stood in lieu of history. These
Ainu had no heritage: a weary race devoid of yesterdays....
Tsuda had seized upon this piece of ritual, but he had subtly
touched it, too, with the finer genius of Shintō. Tsuda could
never outgrow the sacerdotal atmosphere which had surrounded
his youth in the Shinshū mountains. The lure of
the gods was in his blood. This was his other self—his soul’s
deep hinterland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>“These are days again—gn,” he murmured, “of the working
of magics and miracles!” His face looked shiny and very
serious. And the curious thing about Tsuda was that he just
hazily believed, himself, in the magic and the miracles—without,
of course, quite sacrificing any of that conflicting
shrewdness and that worldly subtlety, which were also such
deeply imbedded elements in his nature.</p>

<p>Stella sank down on to the broken slab to watch, curious,
yet with unmoved face. And Tsuda squatted beside her, very
humbly.</p>

<p>“Yes <em>sir</em>!” he murmured. “We see the wonders coming
to pass!”</p>

<p>He raised his fists high above his head in an attitude of
odd yet convincing religious ecstasy. There was a weird,
poetic quality in his voice. Stella felt her soul shrinking.
She seemed on the very brink of some nameless despair.</p>

<p>“These are great days for the children of the White Kami!”
he cried. And he hugged his knees and rocked. And his
eyes were bright. And he wheezed with asthma. Everything
about Tsuda was at once so simple and so profoundly mixed
up. All the complexes of a lifetime of frustration and cleverness
and hard knocks, with always that queer shine underneath
of the priest-wish, seemed converging now into a high
mood of conflict.</p>

<p>“It is good—gn—we think much on the ways of the gods.”</p>

<p>The pagan plea for rain proceeded in the valley at their
feet. The old chief, Cha-cha-kamui, clad in his paraphernalia
of state, including the august crown of shavings and
gilt, sat amongst his people intoning a chant or saga in
a high, shrill voice—a voice so haunting in the still white
sunshine that Stella felt it would echo in her soul as long
as she lived. The chant was slow and of a droning cadence.
At intervals the singer raised his voice in a wailing crescendo,
but the wail always drifted back afterwards into the tonic,
and the chant would recommence and proceed as before.
And all the while the dancers moved on about the leering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
raccoon skull, capering and sprinkling each other with the
symbolic water.</p>

<p>In a flash Stella saw herself, vividly, at home in the old
days, and her heart was seized with a fierce ache. Tears
slipped from her eyes and she never heeded them.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Through her tears she saw the savages below her in the
valley. She saw the chief of the Ainu and heard his wailing
supplication. Mysterious forces....</p>

<p>As she gazed at the cluster of native huts, suddenly her
mind whirled with amazement. The mat at the door of one
of the huts was lifted and her husband came out. He looked
about him a moment a little uncertainly, and then strode off,
disappearing into the jungle.</p>

<p>Stella could feel her heart beating. She turned to Tsuda
to see if he had shared her observation. It was apparent,
from his involved look, that he, too, had seen the White Kami
come out of the hut.</p>

<p>Her mind, so edged with suffering, leapt instantly to a suspicion
which, even after all that she had endured, was potent
enough to fill her with an immense revulsion. At first she
thought she would say nothing at all, but presently she asked:
“Tsuda, whose hut is that my husband just left?”</p>

<p>Tsuda looked humble and reluctant. “The way of the
gods....” he murmuringly began.</p>

<p>But she interrupted him in a dry, rather sharp voice. “Let’s
never mind about all that, Tsuda. Just tell me whose house
it is.”</p>

<p>Tsuda at first was silent. He made a little awkward motion
of appeal toward her with his bony brown hands. But he saw
that he must not evade (clever Tsuda) so in a moment he told
her the truth in a reticent mutter—perhaps just too reticent
to be convincing. The truth he had brought her up here to,
if possible, behold.</p>

<p>“It is the house of the great chief’s Small Wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Stella. A plain dull monosyllable.
There was nothing more to be said. Still, after a little, she
asked, in a voice almost completely strained free of any emotion:
“Does he go there often, Tsuda?”</p>

<p>And Tsuda answered in the affirmative—that is to say, he
answered after his own devious fashion, slowly inclining his
head, but quickly raising it to fix his restless bright eyes upon
her face: “It is written—gn—we must trust the gods in all
things, Wife-of-the-Kami.”</p>

<p>She said she would go back to her rock. And she sat there
all through the day. Sometimes fancy played pranks with
her vision, and she thought the horizon was broken by a tiny
point like the far off bow or funnel of a ship. But she was
always mistaken. The sun dropped into the sea, and the dark
came. When it was too dark to watch any longer she returned
to the house.</p>

<p>For a week Stella went every day to watch for the <i>Star of
Troy</i>. But the ocean rested vacant. On the eighth day she
did not go to the rock at all.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN IMPRESARIO TUNES UP HIS PRIZE FOR BIG MONEY</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Life aboard the <i>Skipping Goone</i> was much sobered by
the death of the little baby. Lili, though her grief
was genuine enough, found a vague refuge in knowing
herself a center of sympathetic interest; but for a time Jerome
was inconsolable.</p>

<p>However, though life was saddened, it must nevertheless
go on. Some of the principal songbirds were preening themselves
in anticipation of the furor they hoped to create in
Africa. Fortunes had been made there. And you never
could tell who might be listening. The excitement all round
was naturally rendered much more pointed by the wonderful
thing that had happened to Miss Valentine in Manila. It had
come at last. She had received a cable message from
America advising her that a private hearing was being
arranged in Cape Town, and stating that a contract offer
might depend on the verdict. The cable was signed by a name
of such awful significance that the enraptured recipient
trembled violently whenever she pronounced it, even to herself.</p>

<p>In her more confident moments Miss Valentine assured
herself (and every one else, for that matter) that her reputation
and fortune were already firmly established; but, being
only human, and not so very far along, even yet, from the lowliness
of her choir-singing days in Galesburg, the fortunate
artist also experienced moments when she felt doomed to certain
disaster. Something would be sure to go wrong. “I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
be so nervous I can’t sing a note!” she confided to the contralto.
But everybody told her of course she’d sing all right,
and everybody was vociferous in congratulation exactly in
proportion to the acuteness of his or her secret envy.</p>

<p>Mr. Curry smiled, then sighed. The bolt had fallen, though
not, after all, quite from the blue. Bolts of this sort never
did fall altogether from the blue any more. It only meant
that in a little while another ornament would find its way on to
his already crowded hands.</p>

<p>Naturally Miss Valentine spent nearly all of her time at the
dinky piano in the cabin they called their “assembly saloon.”
Early and late she worked, and swore a great deal under her
breath, or sometimes proclaimingly, if the note happened to
be <em>very</em> bad, and sometimes she would hurl her music on the
floor and stamp on it, for she was a very temperamental
artist indeed. But when things seemed to be going well,
then she would be just lovely to every one, and say nice things
like this: “I think you have one of the nicest contralto voices
I’ve ever heard, dear,” or: “Now I’ve got those wretched Cs
and D’s where I want them, I’m going to sit down and knit
all day on a sweater for poor little Lili.”</p>

<p>One day she came running up on deck to Mr. Curry, crying
miserably: “It’s gone! I can’t sing a single note any more
that doesn’t sound like a tin whistle, and I feel just like drowning
myself!”</p>

<p>“What’s all this?” asked the impresario cheerily.</p>

<p>“I tell you I can’t even get up to a B♭ without screeching,”
she wailed, weeping copiously into a very small handkerchief.
“And I think it’s just a shame, with the hearing so close!”
Some of the songbirds began whispering a little.</p>

<p>Mr. Curry gave her one of his finest smiles. “You’ve just
gotten yourself all tied up into about a hundred knots, that’s
all. Don’t tell me it’s not so—can’t I see? Haven’t I got
eyes? Now listen to me, my dear child. We’re going to walk
up and down here on deck a few turns, and you’re going to
take some very deep breaths of this sea air—oh, not little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
sniffs like that! What do you think you are, a rabbit? And
now,” he ended confidently, “we’ll see what’s wrong in mighty
short order!”</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>He sat at the piano and faced her, swinging idly back and
forth, his hands loosely clasped. His lips were parted in a
smile of quaint amusement.</p>

<p>“It will never do to try to sing with such a red nose,” he
suggested.</p>

<p>She laughed, in spite of her plight, and struck out at him
playfully in the air, then turned her back and spent an intensive
moment before the tiny mirror of her vanity case.</p>

<p>Curry reached round to the keyboard with one bejewelled
hand and struck a chord. “First your running scale—you
know—with one over the octave.”</p>

<p>She started in bravely, though, just as she had expected,
in no time he had stopped her, and was assuring her she was
working too hard. “Didn’t I tell you you were all tied up?”
Then he struck another chord. “Give me some soft work,
please—some nice, quiet, smooth ‘ti-roos.’ No, no! Piano—<em>piano</em>!
Wait a minute. You’re not on your breath.” He
shook his head critically. “No, you’re not on your breath at
all. Just relax—don’t be afraid—just feel restful. Let your
shoulders down—there!”</p>

<p>“Relaxing won’t get the tin whistle out of my throat!”
she lamented doggedly.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” he soothed. “Try again—‘ti-roo.’” He listened
carefully, his head on one side. “Put it more forward—right
on your lips. Ti-roo-oo-oo. Let the breath carry it.
Now once more.”</p>

<p>Half an hour passed, and still she was too “open.” The
impresario, perspiring a little from concentrated exertion,
scratched his head carefully, so as not to displace the shining
toupee. Then, suddenly inspired, he jumped up from the
piano stool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>“Look here,” he cried, “I want to see what your ribs are
doing. Don’t you <em>dare</em> let them fall on the attack—if you
do you’re lost! When you sing for those smug fellows in
Cape Town I want you to think of your ribs every minute—you
understand? Don’t think about who’s listening to you—<em>think
about your ribs</em>!”</p>

<p>Placing one glistening hand intelligently against the singer’s
ribs, Mr. Curry asked her to sigh for him. “Say: ‘Ooooooo.’”
He waited breathlessly. “No—you let ’em fall! It’s just
what I was afraid of!” He studied her a moment, very
earnestly. Then his face lighted. “Try ‘Ahhhhh.’” And
at last the effort succeeded. “You’ve got it!” he cried exultantly.
“Didn’t I <em>tell</em> you they’d stay up if you went at ’em
right? Now the same thing on your ‘ti-roo.’ Wait a minute
and I’ll give you the key.”</p>

<p>The impresario, keeping one hand firmly on Miss Valentine’s
ribs, reached far out to the piano with the other. “That’s
it!” The next chord was triumphant, and the next chord
after that was more triumphant still. His songbird was coming
back into her own again.</p>

<p>“Feel as though you’re leaning on your face!” he cried.
“Don’t be afraid of your face—it won’t fall out!”</p>

<p>Then he made her send air through her nose with her mouth
open—which made her look a little ludicrous, but then, was
there ever a genuine singer who cared how she looked when
she sang? And he made her sing “La-la-la-la-la,” over and
over again, and told her she ought to feel her tongue wag
up from the bottom of her throat, and talked a great deal
about a mysterious region in back of her teeth, and put her
through the ordeal of the “silent attack.” And then—oh,
well, there was nothing much left to do but sit back and enjoy
the fruits of tireless patience. But they plunged into
arpeggios, for good measure, and the impresario kept nodding,
pleased and more pleased—though he had an eagle eye on her
all the time, too.</p>

<p>She was really singing now—had got all untied—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
tin whistle was cast out. After a little supplementary staccato
work he turned to her with mild, appealing eyes, which
glistened very suspiciously.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>“This may be the last chance we’ll have together like this,”
he said softly, “before the offer comes. While you’re still
one of my songbirds, let me hear you sing some of the old
pieces, like <cite>Annie Laurie</cite> and the <cite>Last Rose of Summer</cite>. I’ll
play along and just dream.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied warmly. “You’re an angel! I’ll sing
anything you like.”</p>

<p>And so she sang him the old songs down in the stuffy little
cabin; and his eyes kept right on glistening, though he smiled
up at her from time to time quite happily. Yes, she sang as
no one, surely, had ever heard her sing before. The impresario
had tuned her up for big money; but now she was
singing just for him.</p>

<p>When he had finished, stealthy forms might have been detected
moving away from the passage outside—not only songbirds,
but seamen too, the mate and the ship’s cook and the
cabin boy; while up on deck Captain Bearman, who had been
secretly listening himself at one of the ventilators, was roaring
and cursing because his ship was lying all unmanned, at the
mercy of the elements.</p>

<p>It was really a shocking state of affairs.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FLYING MOOR</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">The wind, capricious in the extreme, settled on the last
day out from Borneo into an uncompromising head
wind. The schooner laboriously plowed along toward
Sandakan, on the Bornean north coast; it was necessary to
tack constantly, and progress was heavy. The glass stood
low. The air was thick and murky.</p>

<p>“I reckon there’s more rain in Borneo than anywhere else
on earth,” observed the mate, as he and Captain Bearman
stood conversing a few minutes near the wheel just prior to
the latter’s going below for his usual four hours of sleep.
The mate and the captain relieved each other every four hours,
while the seamen worked on a schedule of two on and six off,
day and night.</p>

<p>Bearman made some mumbling reply. Then he began
issuing instructions—a great many more than were really
necessary; and the mate, who knew his business, privately
resented being treated like an apprenticed seaman.</p>

<p>All the passengers, assuming that port would not be made
until morning, had gone below. Captain Bearman at first
had figured that the coast ought to be picked up around noon,
and his binoculars began to be a little in evidence soon after
that—not seeking Borneo itself, but the islands which string
along to the north-east. The wind was very unfriendly and
the schooner laboured as though she had a barge in tow. It
grew dark—and no Borneo. It was slow and heavy-going
progress at best.</p>

<p>The dark came down, and with the early dark, the sky seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
to lighten a little, and a few stars emerged. The wind slackened,
too. But the glass retained its pessimistic outlook, and
clouds were slowly banking ahead.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Below, in the little cabin allotted to them at the time of
their marriage, Jerome and Lili were quarreling. Jerome
looked haggard and sombre since the death of his baby; but
Lili, though she had cried a good deal and had a dull expression
in her eyes sometimes, seemed not particularly altered.</p>

<p>They were not quarreling violently; it was more the irritability
of fatigue and depressing emotion which found utterance
in mutual dissatisfaction. Now that his little son was gone,
Jerome was asking himself how much longer this farce with
Lili would have to be kept up.</p>

<p>Her eyes grew heavier and heavier. Her sumptuous hair
was done into a tight braid down her back. She was already
in her bunk, while Jerome sat glumly on the edge, still in his
clothes.</p>

<p>She nodded and half drifted off for a moment; then, as he
moved, she opened her eyes. And she murmured, her voice
obscurely troubled and with no longer the petulant ring it
had more or less carried all the evening: “Jerry....”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you care about me at all any more?”</p>

<p>“What did you say?” he demanded bluntly, coming back
to his drab present apparently from very far off.</p>

<p>“Jerry, don’t you remember how you used to tease me to
marry you?” she asked, her heavy eyes making a desperate
effort to beam a little.</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember.” And he added, rather dryly: “How
could any one forget a thing like that?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re glad it turned out so you couldn’t,” she
said miserably, her words broadening off into an unquenchable
yawn which seemed somehow, half pathetically, a keynote to
her whole nature.</p>

<p>“I think,” he replied coldly, though in tones rather melancholy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
than bitter, “it’s a good thing for both of us.” And he
concluded, getting to his feet: “I’m going up on deck for a
smoke. It’s too stuffy to try to sleep down here.”</p>

<p>He left her without looking back.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>On deck it was so dark that, until his eyes grew accustomed,
he could see nothing at all. The few stars had gone under
again and the bank of cloud ahead was higher in the sky.
Jerome listlessly threw himself down on deck close to one of
the gunwales and lighted his pipe. The voices of Bearman
and his mate nearby made him feel drowsy. Captain Bearman
was just issuing the last of his instructions before turning in.
The ship’s bell sounded half past midnight.</p>

<p>“As I figure it now,” concluded the ship’s master through
his fiery bush, “we ought to get in a little after dawn. We’ll
be making good headway, and I want to try a flying moor.
Of course,” he added whiningly, “I expect to see those fools
make a mess of it and get the cables all tangled, the way they
did off Port Phillip. But the harbour’s very good here, and
we know every inch of it. We’ll try a flying moor, Mr. Nelson.
And I wish you’d get the lashings off the anchors some time
between now and daylight. You’ll have your hands full without
going to work on the hatch covers. Besides, I think we’ll
run into a thunder storm before morning.” He turned and
walked off without saying good-night.</p>

<p>Jerome heard the mate mutter to himself, just once, in a
disgusted tone: “A flying moor!” He thought of going over
and talking with the mate; for the mate was a very decent
chap. But he felt so comfortable and drowsy where he was
that he decided not to move, even for the sake of learning
what a flying moor was.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Captain Bearman wanted to enter with
the finest flourish known to the profession because he had a firm
persuasion that the <i>Star of Troy</i> would be found riding at
anchor in the harbour. What a triumph to come dashing in
at dawn, full sails, “a bone in her teeth,” and achieve a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
flying moor! But the mate was disgusted because he guessed
the reason and he knew his skipper. It might very possibly
be that the mate hadn’t carried his analysis far enough to know
that his skipper possessed an inferiority complex. But he
knew him for a disappointed and embittered man; had seen
him play the satellite.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Jerome slept. He could breathe up here under the open
sky, and wanted to be alone. For the first time, consciously,
in his life, he felt a full sufficiency in his own being. He had
made a mess of wedding his destiny to other destinies. He
was through with women, and wanted to feel himself free of
them, quite free. It was sweet to lie up here in the dark all
alone and mourn his baby’s death, and begin to pull himself
together a little, and look toward the future.</p>

<p>His life, he felt, was pretty sombre and difficult, despite the
high promise of the release which had given him a start in
the great world. But at least he could take up his burden
and go on alone. It no longer concerned him what Lili did,
or what became of Lili. He was free. And with each puff
of his little short-stemmed pipe, which now looked anything
but jaunty, Jerome felt himself more a misogynist.</p>

<p>When his pipe was smoked out he did not refill it, but
curled up instead, right where he was, with his head on one
arm, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>During the hours that followed he was occasionally half
conscious of voices and passing steps. He slept lightly, and,
as the phrase has it, with one eye open, the way people often
do who sleep out under the sky.</p>

<p>At a little before four o’clock Jerome woke suddenly and sat
up. He felt vividly awake, yet there seemed no cause for it.
Everything was quiet. There was less wind than at midnight.
Dawn was in the sky; but it struggled as yet unequally with
great rolling clouds, dense as boiling tar, which seemed to
have broken loose from some mysterious mooring that had
held them embanked all night. Jerome saw at once that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
Captain Bearman’s thunder storm was upon them at last.
There was a clap quite close at hand, and then he realized
that it was thunder which had aroused him from sleep.</p>

<p>Some of the top sails were flapping a little in a lull that
would be broken any minute—the quietest and most sinister
kind of lull in the whole realm of human experience.</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson, the mate, was giving orders. They could see
the rain coming afar off across the troubled sea. A gust of
wind made the sails strain and the rigging creak in an abrupt,
complex way.</p>

<p>Jerome watched, and the spell of the sea was strong upon
him. He had no terror left. A feeling of restlessness made
him ask himself: “Why don’t I cut loose and ship before the
mast?” He watched the mate and felt his cool authority;
watched the seamen on duty going intelligently about their
work, undismayed by the threatening chaos of the sky. “Yes.
I love it,” Jerome murmured. And then he added, half to
himself and half aloud: “It’s so big and free!”</p>

<p>The mate wanted to get up to the forecastle before the rain
came, if he could, and see if the anchors were all ship-shape
for Captain Bearman’s flying moor; but he waited for the
wheelman to bring the vessel around into the starboard tack.
In his effort to perform this manœuvre neatly, the wheelman
spun the wheel so far that the rudder jammed on the port
side. He made a futile effort to release it and turned deploringly
toward the mate.</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson swore at the man softly and effectively. There
was no bluster about it. The mate knew, and the seaman
knew, it is no light and airy calamity, getting the rudder
jammed. Already the schooner was swinging around before
the wind. In another moment the wind would come over the
port quarter, and the sails would jibe.</p>

<p>“Run up forward and rouse the other men!” shouted the
mate, his words snatched from his lips by a sudden rush of
wind.</p>

<p>The storm was upon them—wind, thunder, rain. With her
rudder disabled, the vessel lay helpless. And the mate had no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
more than spoken when the jigger topmast snapped with a
sharp crack and came crashing down with the topsail and gaff.
The splintered topmast lay on deck, but the gaff had fallen
clean of the gunwale, and floated on the waves. Everything
was in confusion. The sails were jibing, and the seamen
were rushing about, ducking out of the way of the booms.</p>

<p>Captain Bearman came up the companion ladder to take
possession of the deck. (It was the beginning of the morning
watch.) He heard the crash and hastened, his face full of
alarm. But as he emerged, the jigger boom swung round and
struck him in such a way that he was swept clear of his ship,
and, temporarily dazed, recovered his senses in the water.</p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>From out the tempestuous maw of the sea came the bawling
voice of the <i>Skipping Goone’s</i> unfortunate master.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Throw me a line, d’you hear?”</p>

<p>But though the mate heard well enough, he was too good
a seaman to take any heed. Out of the corner of his eye he
had already noted that the jigger gaff floated near at hand.
The captain could temporarily take care of himself, while the
mate took care of the vessel.</p>

<p>It was time for quick action.</p>

<p>They were lowering the sails. That done, the mate caught
one of the seamen by the arm and shouted in his ear: “Go aft
and haul in the log!”</p>

<p>Then rapid preparations were made for taking a sounding.</p>

<p>“Run up forward with the deepsea lead, and carry the line
from the poop, but keep it well outboard”—however, as they
feared, the depth was beyond the reach of their cable.</p>

<p>Meantime, the storm had crashed and roared to the point
of its fullest fury. There was not very much wind, but the
rain was like a cloudburst, and lightning seemed to strike
on all sides of the schooner at once.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” bawled the voice of the skipper. “I can’t
hold out much longer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>They paid no attention, but set to work quickly to rig up a
sea anchor.</p>

<p>“Take that broken jigger topmast,” ordered the mate, “and
slash a piece of canvas—that will do—just slash it on there,
and get some leads for the bottom....” When it was
launched, the sea anchor made the schooner head up out of
the trough.</p>

<p>Orders had to be shouted and reshouted on account of the
fearful uproar of the skies.</p>

<p>“On the port side—”</p>

<p>“The rudder—”</p>

<p>Men called out and ran here and there shouting. But
always the voice that dominated even the fury of the storm
was the voice of the ship’s master out in the sea.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Let down that boat, you swine!”</p>

<p>And then, in the midst of it all, the real calamity befell them.
A bolt of lightening struck the mainmast, shivered it, and
plunged on straight down into the hold of the ship. The
crash of it was frightful.</p>

<p>Terrified faces appeared in the companionway. Songbirds
came scrambling up to see what was happening to them. They
trembled with dismay, and were instantly drenched by the
rain.</p>

<p>At first the mate ordered them below, out of the way.
But almost immediately a new crisis developed.</p>

<p>A seaman ran up, panting: “We’re afire!” His eyes rolled.</p>

<p>Flames, indeed, began almost at once shooting up out of
the hold where the bolt had struck. Everything below was
very dry. From this moment there was no time even to think
of saving the vessel. And now the mate shouted:</p>

<p>“Get all hands on deck! Bring up blankets, and throw
two chests of biscuit into the boats!”</p>

<p>The <i>Skipping Goone</i> was done for. It no longer mattered
whether her rudder was jammed or whether it wasn’t. It no
longer even mattered about her splintered masts. A bolt had
plunged into her bowels, and no power on earth could save
her now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“I guess it’s our scenery that’s on fire!” said Mr. Curry
wildly, rushing about in an effort to make sure all his songbirds
were up from below. A look of amazement and deep
anguish was in his face. “We must get these people off,
Mr. Nelson! Where’s Captain Bearman? Lord, Lord!”—he
was wringing his hands—“it doesn’t seem possible a thing like
this has happened to us!”</p>

<p>The life boats could only be launched from two davits on
the poop deck. One boat always hung there in readiness.</p>

<p>The sea was not running very high, so that it would be
possible to launch the boats and then lower the passengers
into them. The mate shouted his orders.</p>

<p>“Two men at each davit. Easy, easy! Don’t let that line
get wedged there! Now lower!”</p>

<p>The boats were built to hold about twenty each. The ship’s
cook, cabin boy, and two of the seamen went along in the
first boat with the women. Then the second boat, already
hauled up to the davits, was hoisted with some difficulty and
maddening delays, out over the gunwale. Men began sliding
down the rope ladder.</p>

<p>The fire spread rapidly through the hold of the ancient
vessel. Smoke rolled up in huge spirals and puffs into the
dawn of the breaking sky. The squall was passing rapidly
up the world.</p>

<p>“Shove ’er off!” shouted Mr. Nelson hoarsely. And the
second boat drifted loose. Jerome seized an oar, the impresario
another, and they stroked side by side with the seamen.</p>

<p>Slowly the boats pulled away from the doomed old ship
which had seemed to share with them such a deal of human
drama, and which had valiantly brought them so far.</p>

<p>They picked the skipper up; and so overwhelmed was he by
the immense misfortune which had come upon him in so
short a time that he no longer bawled but seemed unable to
do more than stare in a dazed way.</p>

<h4>VI</h4>

<p>It was a glorious dawn. The squall had cleared the air,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
and the sun emerged in a red glare to gaze upon this spectacle
of disaster.</p>

<p>The two small boats kept together and moved slowly off
toward the misty coast of Borneo. By noon, barring mishap,
they would limp into the harbour. However, there would be
no flying moor.</p>

<p>And the <i>Skipping Goone</i>—well, she had settled deeper and
deeper into the sea, till at last, with a distant sound like a
sigh, with her flaming wound and her shattered masts, she
slipped down beneath the waves. The bolt had plunged
through the hull, tearing a ragged gash. Perhaps it had
plunged on down to the very bottom of the sea, for all anyone
knew and for all it mattered now.</p>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Time drew on, through September, October, November.
It was December. It would soon be Christmas....</p>

<p>No disaster in life could be immense enough any
more, Stella felt, to move her. She had “supp’d full with
horrors.”</p>

<p>Perhaps she knew when he passed over the fatal boundary;
perhaps she knew when there could be no more returning.
But it seemed to matter so little now. It was all so ancient,
so long ago.</p>

<p>She saw her prince dissolve into a moral pauper, and could
do nothing. It was almost thrilling, in a way, to realize there
was nothing, absolutely nothing she could do. There came a
time when she even felt that tears would never flow again.</p>

<p>The physical change in King was really unbelievable. He
had so shrunken from his former look of florid strength
and poise and elegance that one who had not beheld the slow
lapse from day to day would have passed him without
recognition. He had played fast and loose all his life, and
within was paying the penalty. His splendour had stood
upon the sand of an encroaching decay. However, of course
there would have been no such precipitous collapse as this
without the powerful push of drug. It was as though
here on Hagen’s Island he had crowded the impetus of years
of indulgence into a few months. The time was brief, in
fact; though to him and to the girl he had fanned at the ball
it seemed like a taste of sheer eternity.</p>

<p>The nights grew hideous with King’s dreaming. He had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
reached the stage at last where dreams usurp the realm of
sleep entirely. Sometimes he would sit perfectly passive
from dusk to dawn, with eyes that stared and saw nothing
but forms of ministering ecstasy. But when he lay down
to sleep, it was as though ten thousand demons all at once
took possession of his brain. Nightmare would suddenly
seize the helm, and he would writhe like some unhappy figure
in Dante’s vision of hell.</p>

<p>Pity rose irresistibly in Stella’s heart sometimes, and she
would go to him and wake him, and hold his hand—out of
sheer human compassion. He had tasted the sweets of opium.
These were the dregs.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would impotently weep as she held his hand,
and tears would seem to calm him, and he would sleep again.
But soon the incubus of dreams would be upon him anew. He
would seem to fall over the very edge of the world—on, on
through space, eternally. Or he would relive his whole
lifetime in an hour, and he often talked of people Stella had
never heard of.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>One night she started up in terror from a deep sleep, and
found King standing over her, a lighted candle in his unsteady
hand. The restless flame kept the whole room dancing.
Grotesque shadows leapt all about the frightened woman as
she sat in bed, one wrist gripped frantically by her husband,
who stared at her in a mood of smouldering horror. For a
time she heard only his breathing, here in the dead of
night. But at length he began muttering to her, his lips
moving almost as though with the awful revenue of nightmare
still upon them. For a time she could not make out
any words, but after a little his tongue attained a thick coherency.</p>

<p>“Clouds!” he mumbled. “Clouds...! I can’t see
anything else—horrible, great black ones, and they roll up
and fill the whole sky...!” His look was awful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>Stella laid a hand on his in an effort to calm him, though
her own heart was on the dizzy edge of chaos.</p>

<p>The candlelight threw up before her a face dead white
against a moving background of shadows. Slowly she felt him
relax. The grasp on her wrist lessened, until finally his
hands were moving about vaguely like moths that cannot find
the light. She looked down and saw dimly the dull red marks
he had left.</p>

<p>She drooped a little and felt all at once very weary.
Her husband sat on the edge of the bed, his back bent and
his shoulders sagging heavily toward his knees. All the old
lordliness in him seemed burnt to cinders.</p>

<p>After a while he sighed a long sigh and slowly got to his
feet. He had put the candle down, and when he reached
out for it, his hand was so unsteady that he knocked it over,
extinguishing the flame. She heard him sigh again in the thick
darkness of the room, and then grope his way out.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Another night he seemed to be trying to fit an endless throng
to shoes. He was upon his knees, and they came up before
him tirelessly out of a void. Stella wakened and crept,
trembling a little, to the door opening into the “parlour.”
Here the air was heavy with fumes. He throve best in such
an atmosphere.</p>

<p>She listened, enthralled in a way. Stella was coming to
feel almost impartial, like an outsider—an outsider even to
herself.</p>

<p>Her husband’s voice drifted to her, hollow and touchingly
patient; but sometimes it sounded a little eager, too—as when
he urged:</p>

<p>“Madam, I think you could wear an A quite as well as a
B. Have you ever tried? The foot is really narrower than
you think. Let me try on one of the newest lasts in an A,
and if it doesn’t feel comfortable, we’ll try a B instead. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
think you’ll find this suede quite satisfactory, and it goes so
well with almost every gown.”</p>

<p>Stella was amazed. She remembered an occasion when
he had spoken of her feet with singular intelligence, and
felt a tiny stir of interest in her deadened heart—even determined
that she would speak to him about it.</p>

<p>The next day she chanced to find him brooding over the
book in which he had long ceased recording the progress
of opium culture on Hagen’s Island. There was a far-away
look in his eyes—a look of great stillness; and she knew he was
under the brief delicious spell of recent indulgence.</p>

<p>“Ferd,” she said, sitting down near him and trying dully
to occupy her fingers with some mending, “you talked all
night about shoes—do you remember?”</p>

<p>At first a vaguely startled expression came into his eyes,
and she had a sudden sense of danger—even drew back a
little, instinctively. But the expression changed to one of
such utter serenity that it grew in time to—almost an ashen
radiance.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he murmured, gazing at her musingly as she sat,
her needle busy. His body shook all over in a light yet constant
way. And he repeated, very dreamily: “Oh, yes. I
remember. There were so many—all sorts of people—and
they came in a line that seemed to stretch clear off to the end
of the world.” He sighed. “Sometimes it seemed as though
I never could take care of so many. But I was all alone,
and there was nothing else to do.”</p>

<p>“Strange,” she said.</p>

<p>“What did you say, Stella?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking how strange it is you should have had a
dream like that....” Her voice sounded flat and monotonous
to her. She realized, even as she spoke, how little
it mattered.</p>

<p>“Strange?” he repeated, still dreamily.</p>

<p>He had the look of a man who feels eternity rolling all
around him. He sat like a Buddhist figure, and the radiance
in his face took on a sublime, translucent quality. Exaltation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
held his soul poised and untortured in a realm of breathlessness
and peace. And he smiled, for suddenly it seemed
to him that his whole life hung together like some perfect
fabric, and that all that had entered it was somehow essential—even
beautiful and almost holy. He laughed, a soft,
murmuring laugh, terrible in its uncanny detachment, and
rocked gently back and forth. His mind grew immeasurably
clear and calm. Then his lips began moving, a flood of
words fell about her—a soft, astounding, irresistible flood.
And she sat there, amazed, trembling, almost under a spell.</p>

<span class="smaller">AVALANCHE</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">“When I was a child,” he said, “I lived in an orphan
asylum. It stood on a hill, and down below there
were a lot of iron foundries. The air was always
full of smoke. It came up sometimes in clouds—in clouds—in
black clouds that even covered up the sun.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Stella, one hand pressed against her cheek.
In the presence of his great serenity her agitation seemed
immense, unendurable.</p>

<p>“I never knew who my people were. From what I could
make out, and it was very little, I guess I must have been
picked up somewhere.” He smiled dreamily. “Yes, I guess
that must have been it. One day I decided to run away.
It was a great many miles to New York, and I walked. Later
on I was earning three meals a day making artificial flowers
in a garret in Bleeker street. I can see it now—most of the
plaster fallen off the walls—dormers sticking out through
the roof—elevated trains going by all day right beside the
windows.... We made everything,” he said, his tone tender
and a little caressing, “from single and double roses to lilies-of-the-valley.
But I liked to make violets best, and they let
me do them most of the time, because I could turn out so
many in a day.”</p>

<p>“Violets....” Stella murmured, and saw again a florist’s
boy standing at her door with a small square box and a note.</p>

<p>“Later on, I became a model in a class of sculptors. Then
for many years I did whatever work I could get hold of and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
managed to keep from starving. You see how beautiful it
all is? But to get to the shoes....”</p>

<p>He paused just a moment, a faint smile signifying what pure
and calm delight this flow of reminiscence brought to his
soul. Then he went on speaking.</p>

<p>“How it happened was like this: A long, long time later,
I worked through a part of one winter in a popular-priced
upstairs clothing concern, posing in the window as a wax
figure wearing the latest thing in business suits. All I had
to do,” he explained with another of his gentle, bubbling
laughs, “was put on a heavy makeup, that I learned how to
do once from an actor I roomed with. Then I dressed up
and walked out into the window. I would strike a pose and
hold it fifteen or twenty minutes, standing without moving.
When I broke the pose, half the people out in the street would
be standing there with their mouths open.” He smiled,
a look of great happiness and light in his wasted face. “They
paid me ten dollars a week. I lived on stew and doughnuts,
and slept a part of the time in a sort of dormitory where the
beds were twenty-five cents a night, with special inducements
if taken by the week.”</p>

<p>The man seemed all aglow and under the sway of eternal
forces. Indeed, as the excitement of narrative grew upon
him he began to show even a tiny flush across his sunken
cheeks, which had become at length so grey and sere. His
eyes were bright and a little wild, as with fever.</p>

<p>King seemed eager that she should know what his life
had been—just as at first he had bowed to her silent mandate
that only what was fine and romantic in it need matter. He
kept exclaiming: “Isn’t it beautiful?” And she could do
nothing but sit there and listen, while, on his serene and
breathless heights he tore the veil from a heart which had so
long been shut away in a realm of glamorous mystery.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>“It lasted nearly all one winter,” he went on. “Then I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
lost this good place because the daughter of the managing
director got crazy about me. She was a pretty little doll,”
he laughed, musingly, “and I guess I might have done a whole
lot worse than marry her. But you see I was nobody, with a
salary of only ten dollars a week, and anyhow, I wasn’t in love
with the girl. But she made such a commotion that they
decided it would be good thing to get me out of the way.”</p>

<p>His look was eager, yet always serene, and he kept rocking
gently. To Stella there seemed in him a horrid new fascination
as he hurled forth at her, though so softly and from so
cloud-kissed an elevation, this startling avalanche of words.
She listened to him with hot flushes. And she could not bid
him stop till he had poured out all his heart to her; she could
not deprive herself of a single bitter drop.</p>

<p>“After that,” he continued, “I decided to go to Rochester,
because I’d found some items in the help wanted columns
that looked pretty good. Moving,” he smiled in lambent
appreciation, “was no great matter. I didn’t even have a
trunk. I just put my things in a paper suitcase and got on
the train. In Rochester I found work in a shoe store. It
didn’t take me long to catch on, and it turned out to be a
very good thing.”</p>

<p>Indeed, it turned out, in quite short order, that fitting shoes
was King’s genuine calling. Business actually increased—especially
on the feminine side of the establishment. “Ladies
came,” he said, with an effect of quiet drollness, “who needed
shoes no more than they needed elephants.” There seemed
to be a peculiar and overwhelming thrill about the mere way
he knelt before them in his superbly fitting clothes. But
the odd part of it all was that this enormous fascination was
just as natural and spontaneous in him as eating or walking.
He became, in a short time, a kind of shoe-fitting matinée idol.</p>

<p>Stella made a vague gesture, but it did not amount to an
interruption. She had merely come to a last little climax in
her immense disillusion. Almost without realizing it during
the past months, with everything else torn asunder in her
life, Stella had faintly clung to the thought that there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
an aura of martyrdom playing out from her position. Other
women before her had married men who, like Ferdinand, had
fallen victims to drug. A man might be very brilliant, even
an actual prince, for that matter, and still destroy himself
with opium. But now the last ounce of sentimental comfort
was drowned in her soul by this sudden outburst of confession—which
yet was no confession surely, so far as the
radiant being before her was concerned. (“It’s all beautiful—isn’t
it!” he murmured.) And she saw with an eye of entire
disenchantment at last that the man she had married had once
been a wax figure in a clothing window, and then a shoe clerk.
How could she think of herself as a martyr after that?</p>

<p>“I liked to hang around hotel lobbies and bars,” he said.
“I would drift around with swells and imagine I was one of
them. In the back of my head somewhere I was always
figuring—I even had some sort of idea that I might meet
somebody some day who would give me a boost.”</p>

<p>He dressed like a dandy and lived in a hall bedroom. He
wore a pearl stick pin and gaiters and believed in “hunches”
and went on fitting shoes. Naturally, all this time, he admitted,
with one of his soft little laughs, there were affairs
of the heart. He withheld nothing, but poured it out upon
Stella in a warm, confounding torrent. Of course a man so
magnetic could not very well escape the toils into which his
sheer perfection of face and form attracted poor dazzled
idolaters.</p>

<p>“I was always getting mash notes,” he said, “from women
I didn’t know from Eve. They were sometimes on monogram
stationery, and scented.... Women were always
wanting to meet me, and inviting me to tea, and begging me to
send them my photograph. I used to get so tired of it
sometimes,” he sighed, yet quite happily. “You can’t imagine
how tired I’d get. I used to want something else, but I
never seemed to know just what....”</p>

<p>Serenely and without a blush, in this curious exaltation
wherein all was tuned to the “master key,” King told his
story to the girl he had finally married. Stella, breathing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
rapidly, her hands clasping and unclasping in her lap, saw
again with singular vividness her husband coming out of the
hut where Cha-cha-kamui’s Small Wife lived.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>“I was forever laying plans,” he went on. “I kept planning
to do all sorts of things, and just went on selling shoes.
I was always figuring. I wanted to be rich and travel off
over the world. I used to collect travel guides and vacation
pamphlets wherever I could find them, in railroads and steamship
offices and hotels. Sometimes you’d be surprised what
beauties I’d pick up in the way of travel booklets! I would
take them home and go through them, figuring and planning.
I got after a while so I knew all the favourite tourist
stopping places about as well as though I’d seen them.” He
smiled with consummate satisfaction.</p>

<p>Stella caught her breath a little, and gazed at her husband
with eyes staring and amazed. “But—” she faltered, out of
her morass of disillusion. “But—Egypt—Monte Carlo—Waikiki...?”</p>

<p>King laughed gently. “Figures of speech, you might call
them, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But Ferd—”</p>

<p>“I used to plan and figure about it all so much, sometimes
I wasn’t quite sure myself whether I’d really seen places or
only imagined I had. It got to be that way. But,” he went
on with a new touch of eagerness in his voice, “there was one
genuine little joy ride. One year a Rochester newspaper
held a contest to decide who was the most popular clerk, and
I won it! Just imagine that! All the women voted for me,
and I got a free trip through Yellowstone Park and on out to
the Coast. I always had that to build on. The rest was
what I hoped I’d do some day....”</p>

<p>“But,” she murmured, “you were picked up at sea—Captain
Utterbourne....”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” King smiled. “I was just starting out to see
some sights then. Somehow or other I’d managed to save up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
two or three hundred dollars. I don’t know how I ever managed
to, with all the demands....” It was dressing like
a prince, he had in mind, and the financing of his endless
small flirtations. “I booked a passage on a rummy old freight
steamer that carried a few passengers. I happened to hear
about it. The steamer was going to some place in Europe—some
little port I’d never even heard of. But it was cheap,
and I thought I’d start out and see what happened. I thought
it would be a grand thing to stop selling shoes and begin
living like a real millionaire. But—I don’t know. I never
quite figured out how it was. Almost as soon as I’d started
I wished I hadn’t. I guess maybe it was a little too late in
life to try to change all my habits, and I’d done so much
planning and travelled around such a lot in my mind that now
I was really starting out to do it, it seemed a little stale
and tame. I really wished I hadn’t started. But by that
time it was too late to turn back.</p>

<p>“The boat wasn’t seaworthy, and somewhere out in the
ocean we broke down. That’s fate, I told myself. I guess
we would have gone to the bottom if Captain Utterbourne
hadn’t happened to come along in his <i>Star of Troy</i>.”</p>

<p>“And then....” Stella just murmured. She saw how
the astonishing tale was approaching, pitilessly and inevitably,
the epoch wherein she herself began to figure; she felt the
imminence, at last, of her own phase, and could only sit there
and listen, while the words fell about her.</p>

<p>And then—yes, then there had been Utterbourne, holding
up before him a glass in which stretched a perspective
of strange new combinations.</p>

<p>“I’d begun to feel so uncertain,” he said, with the first shade
of weariness in his voice. “When I got out at sea, on my
way to some little port, I began to wonder if what I really
wanted wasn’t to settle down somewhere and get a few years
of domestic life before my time came to die. I guess something
of that sort must have been what I wanted all along,
even if I never seemed to know what it was.... I thought
I’d like to go back to selling shoes again, maybe, and try to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
get married, if I could, to somebody who’d know how to make
a snug little home. I went on planning and planning—always
planning.” A faint note of bitterness seemed creeping
in. “When I came home from work, I figured, there
would be a smiling little wife waiting to welcome me with a
kiss and supper. I even figured on a Morris chair and
slippers to put on in the evening, instead of—well, I’ve told
you the sort of life I’d always been used to.... And I
could still go on reading guide books and illustrated pamphlets.
But of course,” he ended with a sigh which grew a little sombre
before he relinquished it, “I couldn’t very well turn down
an offer like Captain Utterbourne’s....”</p>

<p>“Go on,” the girl said. She had heard so much. She
knew she could hear what remained without flinching.</p>

<p>“You can imagine the rest,” he said, his tone growing restless.
“Most of it you know already.” He told her, not
without an increasing though always muffled, groping bitterness,
as the exaltation gradually failed, how his romantic soul
revived. Caesar was himself again. But that queer little
waif of simplicity, almost like homesickness, in his heart,
didn’t quite die of despair, even now. “It was about then,”
he ended, “that I met you, Stella.”</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>She had uttered her cry for romance just as Fairy Fate
happened to be passing by her door. Fairy Fate decided to
have a little fun. Stella wanted a prince. Very well, then,
she should have a prince. However, it was really to the waif
in his heart that she belonged, though she did not know this
at first, and afterward would not have it so, but must ever
strive to persuade herself that he had fallen in love with her
as he might fall in love with Irmengarde....</p>

<p>“What a pity it all is,” she thought, as his feverish tongue
at length lapsed speechless. There was a long silence, and
she thought: “How fooled we both were!”</p>

<p>He sat before her, relaxing now, and trembling. His look
of ecstasy darkened and glimmered out, while his eyes took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
on their old tortured stare. When he spoke, the softness
and breathless simplicity were gone from his voice, which
sounded muddy and harsh. He beat with one fist against
his forehead.</p>

<p>“I’ve been a fool—all my life, such a fool!” he muttered.</p>

<p>The little hectic colour died from his cheeks, and in his eyes
she saw stealing again the awful look of torturing hunger for
opium, which no power could stifle any more.</p>

<p>But she spoke to him very gently. “I understand now,
Ferd. I understand it all.”</p>

<p>And she thought: “It was my price.”</p>

<p>Wearily and mechanically, while he slunk away to the cot
where his smoking materials always were, Stella’s hands took
up the work which had fallen into her lap. She sat sewing,
just as she had sat beside the hearth the day he had begged
her not to stop. “You don’t know how charming it is to
see a woman sitting before the fire, busy with needlework,”
he had said. There was a waif in his heart and he had married
her.</p>

<p>But the tears were spent, and there was nothing left now
but time and silence.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">The inhabitants of Sandakan are still talking about it.
You can corner any one, native or trader, and get a
first-hand account of the amazing spectacle which saluted
the eyes of the awaking town on a certain morning late
in March. If the drinks are on you, and all the circumstances
of the hour conspire toward your informer’s temporal well-being,
you will hear with the full vividness of which a Bornean
is capable, when in the mood, how the slumbering sea delivered
up a couple of over-crowded life-boats with “Skipping
Goone” badly stencilled on the sides. You will hear also
how a bald impresario, bewailing incoherently the loss of a
certain black toupee, clad only in a night shirt and blanket,
but hugging to his breast a huge leather wallet in which reposed
all the receipts from the Manila engagement, led a
bedraggled lot of songbirds up into the town. It was a visitation
such as never before was heard of—at once so tragic
and so screamingly funny. There was much wailing and
gnashing of teeth. Most of the women were in hysterics.
The captain of the outfit, drenched but dressed like an admiral
in honour of the flying moor which never came off,
walked a little by himself with chin plunged despondently
into the fiery midst of such splendid whiskers as the town
had never seen till now. It became a matter of waterfront
gossip that the captain of the vanished schooner was something
of a pariah.</p>

<p>But the town recovered from its amazement and opened
its arms. Within twenty-four hours there wasn’t a single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
surviver of this the most picturesque disaster in the history
of the China sea who couldn’t sit up and give a wholly
original version of the affair.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Two days later, Jerome departed alone for a hike about the
island. The catastrophe had temporarily upset his universe,
just as it had upset everybody’s universe; but this was no
longer the old Jerome, but one who rebounded with far more
elasticity from upheavals. The <i>Skipping Goone</i> was gone,
and with this untimely and sad demise had come an end to Mr.
Curry’s erstwhile triumphant world tour. But Jerome still
had his own life to grapple with.</p>

<p>He tramped many miles, kept reliving in spite of himself
the stark horror of those last moments aboard the schooner,
and after all couldn’t see very clearly ahead. Then there
was still the ache of grief in his heart over the loss of the little
life in which his own had grown so lovingly bound up. He
wandered without aim, alone, through the heavy tropical
sweetness. Yes, he seemed older and more sombre. Domestic
friction and tragedy and now this most recent experience at
sea had combined to give him a new bearing of maturity. He
did not walk like a naïve automaton any more. His gait had
altogether lost its effect of groping, juvenile stiff-jointedness.
His face was sad, and his eyes were a little restless. But
there were new lines of strength, just entering into the picture—dimly
showing—like ghosts of qualities on the way....</p>

<p>Once a brown baby, sturdy and naked and adventurous, ran
on before him shouting and sped out of sight round a bright
epiphytous plant with its peculiarly graceful pendant bloom;
and Jerome, no longer a proud father, saw again with a pang
a small casket lowered into the sea.</p>

<p>Returning toward town later in the afternoon, he found himself
tramping wearily but with a subtly lighter heart along a
winding road across whose sunny face patterns of tropical
vegetation played, faintly breeze-touched and tremulous.
Nothing had really occurred to change the drab look of things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
in his life, but he had grappled honestly, and the trouble in
his heart seemed a little eased. On either side, as he walked,
were fields of tea and tobacco, and off a little way stood a
bamboo cottage flanked by irrigated patches of rice, and with
a great clump of bananas at the doorstep. The sunlight made
everything very still.</p>

<p>He sat down presently on a heap of white stones by the
roadside for a brief rest before tramping the remainder of
the way. Just beside him was a tree half strangled by a growth
of flaming orchids.</p>

<p>Here he sat, for some little time, brooding half purposefully
and half dreamily. It was one of those rather rare moments
when he seemed to see himself with considerable detachment.
Others had been remarking the alteration in him as it so
strikingly developed. Suddenly he seemed conscious of
alteration himself. Life, he thought, had been bumping him
along at a terrific rate. It had all begun—well, hadn’t it?—almost
immediately after the historic quarrel with Stella as
they walked up Market Street together in the fog and seemed,
neither of them, to know just which way to turn. After that,
the curtain had gone up and the play had started. Jerome
musingly reviewed the immense changes that had come into
his life since the day Xenophon Curry entered Oaks, Ferguson
&amp; Whitley’s in quest of provender for his songbirds and a
crew as yet non-existent. And he muttered to himself as he
sat now on the heap of stones resting: “No wonder I feel
different!”</p>

<p>He rubbed his palms lightly and meditatively together and
looked back along the road. From this point it dropped
rather sharply into a valley, and then began a long gentle
ascent, stretching far up and off among the foothills toward the
legend-kissed heights of distant Kina Balu. Sometimes the
road was invisible for a stretch, where a curve deflected its
course; then it would slip back into view again, an ever
narrowing line, but always gleaming in the white light of afternoon.
The young man’s eyes idly pursued it to a far crest,
and in that shimmer of distance he perceived a figure spinning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
along toward him on a bicycle. He watched it glide nearer
and nearer, now slipping out of sight for a time, then re-emerging.
The figure was a woman. He would wait, he
decided, until she had come up and passed him. Then he
would go on his way back to town.</p>

<p>She coasted down the long decline into the depression out of
which rose the sharp little eminence on which Jerome was
seated. Momentum carried the rider half way up the steep
slope beyond. Then, instead of submitting herself to the
fatiguing task of pumping the rest of the way, she dismounted
and walked, wheeling her bicycle along beside her.</p>

<p>He watched her idly as she strode toward him, his stare
being the calculating, half conscious stare of the ever alert
male—something altogether fundamental and which cannot
be disturbed by even so impressive a creed as misogyny.
Jerome assured himself that he had become a confirmed
woman-hater; and yet this admission to no appreciable extent
interfered with the casual interest of his gaze now.</p>

<p>She saw him sitting there by the side of the road, made
glancing note of the fact that the stare was perfectly intact,
normal, and true to type, then came on with a rather bold,
free, just slightly self-conscious swing. She was dressed all
in white and wore on her head a tropical helmet lined with
apple green and which kept her face deeply shadowed.</p>

<p>When she came nearly abreast of the man on the heap of
stones, she gave him the conventional glance calculated to set
at rest any tremble of suspicion that she deliberately avoided
his eyes. All these tactics are so simple and so fundamental,
and facts of such everyday occurrence, that they almost never
attract one’s notice. However, in the present case, the girl
looked quickly back again, then stopped abruptly, gazing at
Jerome in a cool, challenging fashion.</p>

<p>“Haven’t we met somewhere?” she asked him bluntly.</p>

<p>Jerome got up, a little too hastily, perhaps, to do full justice
to the poise and new nonchalance which were coming to be an
intrinsic part of his nature.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he wobbled in surprise. “Have we?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
Surely there was something about her he recognized. “Yes,
I’m sure we have, but I’m sorry to say I can’t exactly place
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s my difficulty, too,” she laughed.</p>

<p>And then something in her half satirical laugh, but
especially in a certain unassailable bovine quality in her eyes,
carried Jerome flashingly back across the waste of centuries
to an all at once vividly remembered occasion.</p>

<p>“Miss Utterbourne?” he said, fumbling a bit with his hat,
which seemed uncertain which hand, if either, would acquire
an ultimate undisputed possession.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” she told him. “And it emphatically annoys
me not to be able to place you more definitely. Wait—”</p>

<p>He gave her a courteous lift.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she exclaimed, though her expression scarcely changed,
“that’s it. Now I remember perfectly. I dimly connected
you in my mind with Stella Meade, but Borneo’s so far off,
and you don’t look at all as I remember you.”</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Both were privately busy for a moment with the circumstances
of their one previous meeting. Things, she shrewdly
decided, must have been happening to him. As for Elsa,
she looked precisely the same as ever. She was still unmarried,
and had just begun a little to take on the vigorous air
of one who is on the verge of becoming really confirmed in
her attitude toward life.</p>

<p>“It’s very surprising we should have run into each other like
this, ’way out here,” she said, taking off her rather mannish
hat and thrusting back her hair with a firm brown hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” he agreed, feeling more at his ease. When
they met before she had really quite terrified him with her
bold, sure, satirical front. Now he was much better equipped
to combat it. He felt he was equipped to combat anything.
“But where have you ever come from suddenly,” he asked,
“riding a bicycle so coolly out of nowhere at all?”</p>

<p>“I’m on a trip with dad,” she told him. “We brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
Aunt Flora as far as Manila and dropped her there. But
I’m going to stand by the ship all the way back to San Francisco
again.” There was a hidden smile in her words which
seemed to exult in a certain stability of will not shared by
the romantic Aunt Flora. “I like it for a change,” she went
on with a slight drawl. “I never dreamed in the first place
the Captain would let me come.” And she laughed briefly.
“He’s always such an old bear about business. But there
wasn’t any difficulty. It only goes to prove,” she ended,
shrugging humorously, “that you never can tell about the
Captain until you try. I’m having a bully time, though the
days at sea are usually pretty dull. As soon as it’s possible
to establish shore connections anywhere, I make off at once
with my bicycle.”</p>

<p>“I’ve met your father—Captain Utterbourne,” said Jerome.</p>

<p>“Have you? Yes—I don’t know why—I assumed you knew
him. Dad seems to meet everybody sooner or later. He’s
absurdly promiscuous—not meaning anything personal,” she
laughed, without really qualifying her easy tactlessness.
“And yet,” she added, in a drawl not so very unlike her parent’s,
though it seemed a few shades brighter, “dad’s not what
I’d call the mixing kind.”</p>

<p>Jerome was silent, and in a moment she went on, drooping
her eyes and smiling calmly: “But it hasn’t been explained
what you’re doing in Borneo.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m stranded here,” he smiled.</p>

<p>She gazed at him blankly.</p>

<p>And then, before going deeper into his plight, he asked:
“But how did you get in without any one’s seeing you? I
don’t understand, for I swear I know every ship in the harbour
by this time, and the <i>Star of Troy</i> certainly wasn’t hereabouts
this morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but a great deal may happen since morning, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I realize that,” he admitted. And he vaguely hoped,
and really believed, that his tone smacked somewhat of
cynicism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>“You should stick right to the waterfront in these exciting
seas,” she advised him, “if you don’t want to miss what’s
going on. We dropped anchor just at noon today. We came
up from the Celebes, where dad did some business. Right
after tiffin I rowed ashore and started off to see the sights.
I’ve seen them,” she ended humorously, and with just a
tinge of restlessness. “Now I’m ready to move on to some
other place. The older I get the more insatiable I seem to
grow.”</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t linger about the waterfront long enough,”
he thrust back, “to be quite posted yourself about what’s
going on.” His sad eyes had a little sparkle in them.</p>

<p>But of course her most effective weapon was always the
unassailable gaze—not, however, that she used it quite consciously.
And as she gazed, Jerome felt a trifle uneasy. He
couldn’t help himself.</p>

<p>“You had no chance,” he expanded, “to hear about the
<i>Skipping Goone</i>.”</p>

<p>She repeated the name after him with the inflection of one
who half remembers or is not quite sure. “Wait a minute.
It’s not a name one forgets in a hurry. Oh, I know! She’s
the schooner Aunt Flora was always talking about. Sometimes
she called her that, and sometimes she mixed the goone
up with other birds, but I never corrected her because Aunt
Flora’s so delicious when she gets things just a little wrong.
I believe dad had something to do with that schooner in the
first place, didn’t he? Some queer business of getting a
skipper, or something of the sort?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was it.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Flora told me some very amazing things about the
man who’s taking an opera troupe around the world. There’s
been a lot about it in the papers, and I remember dad’s
shouting over it, too.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” replied Jerome. “It must have seemed a
thing to shout over at first. And yet we managed to make
a go of it, in spite of everything, until—”</p>

<p>“You!” For once she was surprised into a very slight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
change of expression. “But you aren’t one of them? You’re
not a singer?”</p>

<p>“No, not a singer. I tried to be,” he explained, the sadness
in his face temporarily lightened by this unexpected
little roadside duel, “but there seemed no opening for a fog
horn.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that the <i>Skipping Goone</i> is lying right here
in the harbour, and that we passed her by without a
salute? It must never get to Aunt Flora!”</p>

<p>“The <i>Skipping Goone</i>,” Jerome replied solemnly, “is out
yonder, about ten miles, at the bottom of the sea.”</p>

<p>And he told her the story briefly and simply.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>“Which way were you walking?” she asked him, obviously
impressed by his adventure.</p>

<p>“I’m on my way back to town. We’re merely camping here
till we can get a boat out.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s walk back together,” she suggested.</p>

<p>“May I wheel your bicycle along?” he requested in a rather
worldly way.</p>

<p>And she surrendered it to him—not because she subscribed,
of course, in even the faintest degree, to any of the old sex
superstitions, but simply because Elsa was so splendidly
emancipated that she could be unquestionably glad to rid herself
of an encumbrance when possible, with no thought about
it one way or another. Otherwise her surrendering it must
have seemed a faint contradiction. So Jerome took charge of
the bicycle, and she walked beside him with free, full stride,
while he harked back into the realm of ancient history and
told her, discreetly and with ever an effect of budding cynicism,
the thrilling tale of the kidnapping—or rather, his accidental
departure—in the first place, and something of his
adventurous life after that. She appeared very much interested.
And it seemed so good having some one entirely outside
his now largely harrowing association to whom he could
talk, that Jerome found himself looking upon Elsa Utterbourne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
as really an old friend. He did not mention Lili, and
left uncommunicated the heartache connected with the loss of
his tiny son at sea. It seemed almost incredible—almost like
a strange illusion—that all this could have happened to him
since the day in San Francisco when Elsa Utterbourne had
come along to contemplate, without entirely knowing it, his
sense of forlornness and pique.</p>

<p>“Do you know where Stella is now, by the way?” he asked
casually.</p>

<p>Elsa looked at him in a somewhat sidewise fashion. “I
rather thought you’d be able to give <em>me</em> a little news of her.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve not heard a word since she went away on her
honeymoon.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I, nor has any one else, so far as I know.”</p>

<p>“Strange. You’d think the earth had swallowed them up!”</p>

<p>“Yes, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“But your father took them off in the first place—he must
have some idea, at least, where they are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Captain knows exactly.”</p>

<p>“But he won’t tell?”</p>

<p>“No, he won’t tell. The only way would be to take a
chance on his talking in his sleep. But the trouble is,” she
smiled dryly. “he never even snores—he sleeps like the
Sphynxes.”</p>

<p>Jerome gave her a glance of amusement.</p>

<p>“No doubt,” continued Elsa, “they’ll turn up one of these
days with some unbelievable adventure to relate.”</p>

<p>“I expect so.”</p>

<p>As they walked Elsa shaded her eyes with an arm from time
to time, and gazed coolly off across the panorama which kept
spreading new pictures. Occasionally a native with empty
baskets would pass them, trudging back from the coast where
beeswax and tobacco had been traded.</p>

<p>“If you’d like to come out this evening, you’ll find us at
home,” the girl said as they approached the port.</p>

<p>“You’re staying on board?”</p>

<p>“We always do. It’s very comfortable. We have plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
ice, and plenty of things to mix with it. You’d better come.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I believe I will.”</p>

<p>She nodded, and, recovering her bicycle, rode off down to
the wharf, where a small boat awaited her.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Yes, the <i>Star of Troy</i> had slipped into the harbour of
Sandakan, and rode there at anchor in a dreamy
way, as though, despite her grim and business-like
appearance, it had suddenly become her destiny to drift idly
at her ease forever upon an idle tropic sea. A little dry-looking
smoke dribbled off her stack. There appeared no
signs of life aboard.</p>

<p>Visitors were usually received in Captain Utterbourne’s
snug little white cabin—or his “shop,” as he preferred calling
it: a delightful place, walls and beamed ceiling
scrupulously painted, floor dark and highly polished. There
were a couple of good brass ships’ lamps, always perfectly
spotless and shining. A faint aroma of metal polish merged
with that thrilling, indefinable scent which belongs in greater
or less degree to the cabins of all ships.</p>

<p>Elsa, looking very cool and wise, was mixing something
in a shaker, assisted by a young Chinese boy whom Captain
Utterbourne had picked up in Hong Kong, and who was
supremely devoted. The girl spoke to him now and then in
low tones, and he smiled at her with affectionate understanding.</p>

<p>Captain Utterbourne, turning a fresh cigar about with
slightly mincing appreciation, was receiving accounts of the
wreck of the <i>Skipping Goone</i> as they fell indiscriminately
from the lips of Captain Bearman, Xenophon Curry, and a
certain young man with a very sophisticated face and troubled
eyes whom Elsa had encountered by the roadside during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
the afternoon. The master of the <i>Star of Troy</i> seemed rather
to have an eye on Jerome, and there was something like
amazement lurking behind the efficient poker mask.</p>

<p>“I never had such a run of bad luck in my life,” Captain
Bearman whined, his embittered lips seeming rather to steal
over and fold in the words than cleanly to emit them. “I
simply go below for a wink of sleep, and before I can get back
again that ass of a mate....” His manner was an odd
blend of self-conscious indignation and uneasy dignity.
“First the rudder—then he lets her jibe—and I’m knocked off
my ship into the sea! I can’t tell you, Captain, what I went
through out there in the water—that mate....” His face
gleamed white with the rage that was in him. “He ought to
be brought to trial—I mean to see about it. It amounts to
mutiny, I say!”</p>

<p>Captain Bearman’s eyes went rapidly about; and he was
harassed by a disagreeable sense of not having quite succeeded,
after all, in defending his position. However, this
was but a logical phase of his destiny, which always, in the
end, must simply be bowed to.</p>

<p>“Lord, Lord!” exclaimed the impresario. “It seems incredible
we should go through what we did and all live to
tell the tale! But when I saw my scenery going,” he continued
with a sigh, “I knew that was the end of the world tour. It
takes the ground from under a man—everything wiped out
in an hour....” He looked tired and seemed even to have
aged; but nothing could ever rob that smile of its incorrigible
strength and sweetness—a smile so full of confidence in the
inherent good of an often enough unfathomable scheme of
things. However, transcending everything else just now was
the startling and ludicrous aspect of the impresario’s head
without the toupee, which had been, for all who knew him,
so essential a feature. Without the boyish bangs he had somehow
a naked, lost look, which lured out smiles all round,
though the situation was grave and sober. It was like the
laughing twist of a comet’s tail through empyreans of stern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
and awful purpose. Or it was like the drunken porter’s
soliloquy in <cite>Macbeth</cite>.</p>

<p>Elsa superintended the distribution of the drink she had
been concocting, and they all sat sipping. Jerome’s eyes
rested upon a map of the world covering one wall of the
cabin. There was the whole world outspread; the route of his
adventurous travels, with their complement of personal
growth, could be traced league by league. He felt some
one gazing at him curiously, and when he turned met Elsa’s
eyes.</p>

<p>Talk broadened to consideration of other sea disasters,
the theme seeming to hold a subtle fascination; and Utterbourne,
discoursing about “runs of luck,” aired certain slightly
nebulous theories about “rhythm” in such matters. And then
they returned to the wreck of the <i>Skipping Goone</i>, and Jerome,
conscious that Captain Utterbourne was following
him with quizzical attention, told at some length of the
tussles he was having over insurance and the cargo tangle generally.</p>

<p>“There’s been some rumpus about witnesses—it’s lucky
I had presence of mind to grab the books before leaving the
schooner.” He laughed shortly. “It’s worse than any mix-up
I ever got into in the chandlery line!”</p>

<p>He drank the last of his cocktail; and the Captain, staring
at him blankly, mused: “How the devil has a fellow of this
type managed to change so utterly in one short year? How
the devil?” There was a glow behind the sleeping quiet
of his baffling eyes. Experience, the Captain concluded with
a sly wink of relish, must have acted in the case of young
Stewart—h’m?—like a sly milligram of radium. For the
Captain was very fond of analysing people—considered
himself extremely clever at it; and, while he sometimes made
mistakes of which nobody knew anything, he was, on the
whole, a pretty shrewd judge of human nature. And with
him analysis always moved hand in hand with the musing
query: Is this a man I can use somewhere? The process had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
become really subconscious. As he watched Jerome he
narrowed his eyes a little.</p>

<p>“We seem to be a deadly poison—h’m?” observed Captain
Utterbourne a little later in his lynx-like drawl, conversation
having by this time turned upon one of his most cherished
themes: the deleterious influence of civilization on the
human race, and especially the havoc wrought by Christianity.
It was perhaps a trifle vague; but the other captain, setting
down his glass, nodded with that peculiar brand of admiring
speechlessness one would expect to encounter in a satellite
who seemed thus to convey: “Exactly what I’ve always insisted,
but these fools won’t listen to reason—you can’t get
’em to!” And from time to time, as startling figures emerged
concerning the decline of savage life under enlightened rule,
Mr. Curry would cry: “Is it possible?”—almost as though,
right on top of all his own troubles, he half recognized here
a human challenge to do something.</p>

<p>“By the way, dad,” demanded Elsa, “speaking of savages
in general and Borneo in particular, when do we sail on?”</p>

<p>For a moment Turk met Turk, with faces that defied each
other in the matter of inscrutability.</p>

<p>“Anxious already—h’m?” her father parried—for he loved
to pit query against query.</p>

<p>“Not especially,” she replied with a restless toss of her
head, yet without accentuating, as she so often did at such
times, the drooping of her cow-brown eyes. “I find these
places a bit dull, Captain,” she added, drawling. “I suppose
it’s the effect of civilization.” Her dry thrust went home,
and his eyes subtly twinkled. At such times he looked ever
so human and guileless.</p>

<p>“Well,” capitulated Captain Utterbourne, his words lethargically
purring, “I’m liable to be held up here some little
time by fellows who are bringing down some tobacco from the
interior. I didn’t know,” he suggested with icy, tempting
hesitation, giving his daughter a playful yet challenging look,
“but we might slip off together some day down toward Sarawak
to see if we couldn’t capture a few ourangs, or perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
a rhinoceros or two. Maybe you’d find that more exciting.
I understand there’s still a little wild life left in the remoter
realm of the raja.”</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>A day or so later Jerome, emerging from the office of a
ships’ broker, met Elsa again. She was swinging along in
her independent way, and he thought she had not even seen
him, till abruptly she paused, her gaze just lighted, incidentally,
by a smile of greeting.</p>

<p>“Have you found a ship yet?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s a sailing for Yokohama in a few days. We’re
going on there and take a Pacific Mail boat back to San Francisco.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re anxious to start.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not.”</p>

<p>“No?” Her blankness was disturbed by the merest flicker.</p>

<p>“Borneo’s out in the world, and San Francisco isn’t,” he
explained, smiling a little, but obviously serious, too.</p>

<p>“I see what you mean,” she said after a pause. “It’s
quite interesting. It even makes Borneo almost tolerable.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he qualified, “of course I don’t necessarily mean
Borneo in particular.”</p>

<p>“I understand. Why do you go back, then?”</p>

<p>It was almost the very thing Lili had asked him when the
proposition of his returning ignominiously from Honolulu
held the boards. However, it was with by no means the old
air of helplessness and groping that he put squarely up to
Elsa the question: “What else can I do?” Openings in Borneo
were not conspicuously numerous—that was certain.</p>

<p>She gazed at him intently. And then she murmured in even
tones: “True, what else could you do?”</p>

<p>He looked off toward the harbour a little dreamily. “Perhaps,”
he said, “something will turn up in Yokohama. We
have nearly a week there, and I mean to pry around.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I would.” But somehow her look seemed not precisely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
to fit the words. And after a moment she asked
him: “Is there anything you have in mind that you’d like to
do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he replied with quite worldly carelessness.
“Anything that would keep me busy and not let me drop back
into a slump again.”</p>

<p>“You think there might be danger?” she calmly laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he smiled. “I don’t want to try!” And
then he asked her: “How much longer are you staying on,
Miss Utterbourne?”</p>

<p>She shrugged. “You never can tell what the Captain may
take it into his head to do. I never dare go very far away
from the ship for fear they’ll suddenly decide to haul up and
move off. But as long as I stick around and look eager it’s
just another case of the watched pot. I’m ready anytime he
is,” she concluded, her eyes drooping.</p>

<p>“And you don’t know where you go from here, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No.” She moved her head a little restlessly.</p>

<p>After a moment she said: “Well,” nodded informally, and
went on. Jerome watched her till she disappeared from view—a
trim, independent figure, with youthful stride.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>A few more days passed. Early on the morrow all the
stranded victims of shipwreck would be aboard a steamer
bound for Yokohama—all, that is, except Miss Valentine,
who by hook or by crook must reach Cape Town, and for
whom a circuitous passage had been booked, after much
dickering and consultation. Mr. Curry was taking his songbirds
sadly back to San Francisco, where the little company
would disband—not without tears, surely, when the time
came. Indeed, already there had been tears. And, with the
terrors of shipwreck still so fresh in their minds, the loyal
songbirds had got together and drafted a declaration pledging
themselves to stand by the impresario through all the arduous
hardships of a slow reorganization, if he would but say
the word. The comedian made a humorous speech. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
voice broke in the midst of it, and then he hurried on more
humorously than ever. Curry was deeply touched. He said
he felt unworthy of such devotion. And then he told them
that since he’d lost everything else, he couldn’t ask them to
stand by any longer. It wouldn’t be fair to them. He must
let them go, each his own way. It wrung his heart, but he
must let his songbirds go. However, he would help them
all he could; and if ever fortune smiled upon him again, he
would call them back, even though they might be scattered
to the very ends of the earth!</p>

<p>Jerome, on this last evening in Borneo, left the place where
he was lodging and strolled along the waterfront, musing
and trying to map his life. After an hour or so with his
pipe as sole companion, and his thoughts roaming far, he
turned back, deciding to go to bed early, since it would be necessary
to rise at dawn. He still felt that vague loathness to
begin the homeward voyage which had more or less bothered
him ever since the disaster at sea. It would be sweet to see
his own people once more; yet he dreaded lest returning to
the haunts of his long obscurity might mean but the beginning
of a slump which, however gradually, would thrust him back
again into the same position whence he had so miraculously
risen. Of course Jerome knew perfectly well that he was
his own master, and that, in the highest sense, his future
would be just exactly what he chose to make it. Nevertheless,
as he had pointed out to Elsa in whimsical vein, Borneo
was out in the world, whereas San Francisco wasn’t.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” he muttered, “it’s adventure and life and hustle
and bustle and even danger I’ve come to require. I can’t get
along without these things now I’ve had a real taste of them.
I’ve simply got to go on and on!”</p>

<p>The germ of seeing things happen, and of being himself in
the thick of heavy action, had penetrated into his corpuscles—kept
racing through his arteries like possessed. He was in
a state of intoxicated revolution, underneath his new exterior
of worldly poise. Obscurity had been overthrown with
violence; it had been assailed, cast down, trampled upon;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
it was extinct. But Jerome, for all his emancipation, was
vaguely fearful of ghosts.</p>

<p>Ventures such as this of Xenophon Curry’s didn’t, he knew,
bloom on every bush along one’s way. And rumination had
drawn him into a mood sober and regretful by the time he
reached the house where his bed was: a frame of mind tending
wonderfully to augment the thrill of surprise which
accompanied a sight of Captain Utterbourne’s Chinese boy
awaiting his return with a note.</p>

<p>Jerome took the note, opened it, read it through rapidly.
He could feel his heart thumping. The communication bespoke
his immediate presence aboard the <i>Star of Troy</i> by way
of answer. The boy smiled with all his white young teeth,
and, in gentle sing-song English, admitted the matter must
be urgent, since his instructions were to wait all night if
necessary, and to bring back with him no answer but “Misser
Stoot.”</p>

<p>What could it mean? Somehow Jerome kept remembering
how peculiarly Elsa had gazed at him when she said:
“True, what else could you do?” As a matter of fact, he
had once thought of speaking to Captain Utterbourne about
an opening of some sort; but the opportunity hadn’t just
seemed to develop. Here, as though determined he should
be kept vividly in the swim, fate submitted an eleventh hour
opportunity. Did it amount to that?</p>

<p>He followed his oriental guide eagerly.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">“Did you ever hear of Daedalus?” asked Captain
Utterbourne dreamily when his caller had been
shown into the little white cabin he called his
shop. “I’ve just come across a fascinating account of him
in a book of myths. Daedalus, it seems, was the man who
invented sails. Like all advanced spirits from the beginning
of time, he was looked upon as mad—just because he was
always experimenting—trying to fasten sails on to his own
body, and similar devices—h’m? Isn’t it funny how little
it takes to make the world think you mad?”</p>

<p>It wasn’t, perhaps, quite tangible—almost, in fact, as
though the master of this romantic freighter were himself,
after all, part of a myth. “And anyhow,” puzzled Jerome,
“tangible or not, what has Daedalus, even if he did invent
sails, to do with this hurry-up call on my last night in
Borneo?”</p>

<p>His glance discovered upon the table a sheet of paper
scrawled over with anchors in many positions. The Captain
had evidently been busy on them prior to his arrival. Then
his glance strayed to the map of the world, and again, in a
parenthetical flash, he felt its peculiar thrill—almost as
though it were a special or enchanted map. Jerome had
always more or less responded to the thrill of maps—a little,
even, in the funny old school geographies. Now that he
was himself abroad upon it, the spell was brightly multiplied.
What a pace he had gone! At length he was aboard
a ship in the harbour of Sandakan, listening to a story about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
the man who invented sails.... And back of the story there
was something—something.... The suspense was terrific;
yet “I must be patient,” he told himself; for he guessed that
the Captain was a man who, like certain horses, would only
proceed the more slowly if urged.</p>

<p>Finally Utterbourne, perceiving with a quick glance of his
little grey eyes that his visitor seemed momentarily absorbed
in the map on the wall, swung slowly round in his swivel
chair. Appearing to forget Daedalus entirely, he rocked back
and forth, his hands spread loosely on his knees. A light
of quizzical and devious affection flickered into his face, and,
gazing at the young man before him he murmured:</p>

<p>“Stewart, did you ever sit down before a map of the world
and just let yourself go? H’m? It’s a gorgeous piece of
adventure!”</p>

<p>After that the Captain sat for a time without saying anything
at all—only drumming idly with a pencil. There was
something fiendish about these silences; yet out of them, one
could be sure, great things were wont to grow.</p>

<p>“I’ve been wondering—h’m?” And still he drummed, his
upsetting gaze never quite leaving the other’s face, though it
wavered a bit at intervals to a point just beyond, only to
return at once. The substantial ticking of a brass clock set
into the wall above the Captain’s desk added an effect of overtone
to the silence which had fallen between them. Jerome,
breathless with impatience and excitement, cleared his throat,
and Utterbourne said: “H’m?” in a murmur of unbroken
meditation. But at last the Captain stirred, laid aside his
pencil—which seemed a sign they were making progress—clasped
his hands loosely on the table and said:</p>

<p>“I sent for you, Stewart, because I thought—h’m?—I
thought you might be able to help us out.” He hesitated,
still quizzical. “You’ve been on my mind, rather, ever since
I began hearing about your extraordinary exploits this year.
To be perfectly frank”—he smiled, and Jerome, guessing
what the Captain would say, smiled back easily—“I shouldn’t
have quite picked you out—well, say that night in the Pavillon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
d’Orient—as a man I’d ever be likely to see my way clear
to using. But,” he went on, his voice subtle with congratulation,
“a man—h’m?—a man can’t have the experiences you
seem to have had without developing a kind of feeling”—he
held the thought a little sensuously suspended a moment—“a
feeling for the finer grain in adventure—h’m? It’s
pretty hard to phrase; it’s a thing to be sensed.”</p>

<p>Jerome would have spoken, his eyes, now, quite aflame with
delighted excitement; but the Captain lifted one hand in a
faint gesture and went on speaking: “Stewart, I’ve been thinking
you may be one of the men I’ll have need of when we
launch a project we have in mind—h’m?—a sort of office
and clearing house for our Mediterranean trade—maybe at
Naples, or perhaps Tripoli—the plans are still very much
in the air. I knew you were sailing in the morning,
and I wanted to sound you a little—in fact, I didn’t know
but you might be induced to come along with us instead—h’m?”</p>

<p>Again Jerome was eager to voice his sentiments in this
connection, and again the Captain, perceiving his eagerness,
chose to hold him in a torment of unreleased speech. “I
presume,” he drawled, “you’re anxious to get home after
your life-and-death struggle with the Dark Angel—h’m?”
There was a smile on Utterbourne’s lips, a smile of chilly,
faint derision, since, so far as he was concerned, the Dark
Angel was at liberty to pause on his threshold whenever the
impulse prompted; he would be ready, without question or
prayer. “But, as a matter of fact,” he resumed, “I expect
to reach San Francisco myself maybe sooner than Curry and
his songbirds—or at any rate not very much later. If you
care to consider the Mediterranean business at all, but feel
you’d rather not run the risk of reaching home a week, a day,
or even an hour later, then go on tomorrow with Curry, and
I’ll get in touch with you afterward. H’m? If, on the other
hand, you’d like to come along with us now, I could perhaps
lay a sort of ground-work in your mind between here and
San Francisco, which might facilitate matters in case it developed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
that we wanted to get things under way rather
quickly.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Jerome (permitted at last to speak) with a
voice he tried hard to keep perfectly steady, “that I’ll run the
risk!” His eyes sparkled a little. “Would you like me to
sleep on board tonight? I’d hate like the devil to wake up
somewhere else and find all this was only a dream!”</p>

<p>Then Utterbourne laughed. That is to say, he shouted. And
when Jerome was gone, he sat in the dark on deck a long
time, smoking one cigarette after another, and gently humming
<cite>To a Wild Rose</cite> at intervals.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Jerome couldn’t wait till morning to break the news to Curry,
but got the impresario out of bed. There were new lines of
worry and care in the good man’s face, but his enthusiasm
over the offer which had been made his erstwhile business
manager was wholly unfettered. At first he blinked sleepily,
and said: “Well—well....” in a somewhat solemn, deliberating
way. But when he woke up sufficiently to realize that it
wasn’t for advice but for congratulation that the business manager
had roused him, then Curry became satisfactorily
boisterous. In fact, they both became a little boisterous,
for Jerome had smuggled in sandwiches and a bottle of something,
and insisted upon an impromptu celebration right on
the spot.</p>

<p>It was well along toward morning before the weary maestro
was left to a little snatch of needed slumber. As for Jerome,
he didn’t go to bed at all. He felt it would be out of the
question even to think of bed. And he wanted to be on hand
early to corner Lili with the facts and give her, he told himself,
some general instructions. He whistled along the waterfront,
deserted and very full of echoes at this hour, and
finally settled down on a barrel of tar to wait for sun-up.</p>

<p>Jerome had scarcely seen Lili since the arrival in Borneo—and
had, indeed, given her deliberately a wide berth. It was
essential, he felt, to begin making it plain to all the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
that they weren’t living together any more. Now he began
wondering how she was making out, and what she had been
up to. Poor Lili, he thought. She seemed so helpless, so
little able to look out for herself. He must see what could be
done. Perhaps he could arrange to send her part of his
salary for awhile. He would see how reasonably she took the
news of his desertion.</p>

<p>The songbirds began to appear, clad in outlandish togs
which had been acquired helter-skelter in a mart where there
was little in the way of choice. They were all in good spirits,
however. “On to Yokohama!” had been adopted as the
company slogan. After that—well, no one seemed to care
to bother very much yet about the future. Things would turn
up, as they always did, somehow or other.</p>

<p>Jerome was just deciding that happy-go-lucky Lili had
overslept, as she so frequently did, and debated ascertaining
her lodgings and going off to hunt her up, when suddenly
he beheld her coming along, garbed in a queer pink dress
and wearing an enormous hat trimmed with blue roses and
fur. She had a little white dog on a leash, and it strained
sniffingly ahead, running in a spindle-legged, sidling manner.
She was right upon Jerome before she discovered him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jerry!” she cried. And at first her eyes beamed with
the sheer pleasure of encountering him; but almost at once
they took on a hurt, reproachful look, and all the beam was
gone out of them. Her lips went into a disappointed little
pout.</p>

<p>He wasted no words, but acquainted her simply and frankly
with the facts in the case. Their ways were to sever. Tomorrow
at this hour they would be hundreds of miles apart.
It was unlikely they would ever meet again.</p>

<p>“Oh, but Jerry....” she faltered.</p>

<p>“It’s up to you,” he concluded, “to do the rest. They
know we’ve not been getting on. Now it will be very easy.
You may tell them anything you like. I don’t care how
strong you make your case—I guess I can stand up under the
strain. But I should think that simple desertion would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
about as good as anything. Just one request: Please don’t
tell them I was in the habit of hitting you with clubs. I’d
hate any one to think that of me. But I know you’ll work it
out. And if you want to say I fell in love with some one else—if
that would help—why, go ahead, only please have a
heart and don’t make her some little painted fool. I’ve
written my address on this piece of paper”—he handed it
over—“and if you have trouble financing things for awhile,
just get in touch with me and I’ll see what I can do, though
as you know, I’m not by any means a pluto <em>yet</em>!”</p>

<p>She seemed a little bewildered by it all. As a matter of
fact, it was a rather bewildering speech. And before she
had quite found her bearings, Lili murmured, with tears
threatening: “We were so happy together once, Jerry—oh,
I could cry my eyes out at the way you’re treating me!”</p>

<p>“But,” he reminded her, “you know it was already agreed
we were going to separate. There’s no use going into all that
again. And I don’t think we better be too thick together
this morning, either. What you tell ’em must be convincing.”</p>

<p>But she had had time to get over the first shock, and her
manner now grew assertive. “Oh,” she cried, “that’s all
very well, my fine fellow, but you don’t seem to be considering
<em>my</em> feelings in the matter. You just skip out and
leave the hard part for me. If that isn’t just like a
man!”</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>The blue roses on her hat were shaking, and the absurd
dog kept jerking at his leash, sometimes even forcing her to
take a step and regain her balance. Jerome was beginning to
feel slightly upset.</p>

<p>“Everybody thinks we’re married,” she babbled, rather
disconnectedly, “and that makes it just about the same as
if we were. All you do is light out, but what about <em>me</em>?
That’s what <em>I</em> want to know!”</p>

<p>“We talked everything over,” he repeated glumly. “I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
care to argue about it any more. It’s only fair I have my
chance now.”</p>

<p>But she was piqued, and her lips still pouted; and then,
out of the muddled wretchedness of her heart, she cast up at
Jerome the reminder that if she hadn’t been so honest in the
first place he’d be her husband now, this minute—he couldn’t
help himself. “And then,” she ended, in truly flaming, if
somewhat confused triumph, “I guess you’d be a little more
cut up about this divorce business—it wouldn’t look quite so
easy to you, anyhow, as it does this way!”</p>

<p>“But you had to, Lili!” cried Jerome, not a little horrified,
for a moment, despite his worldly poise, at the vista her
sordid dreg of self-revelation opened up. “You <em>had</em> to tell
about your marriage....”</p>

<p>They looked at each other rather helplessly, till, her mood
softening, she faltered: “You never used to be so high and
mighty with me, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“But great heavens, Lili, you don’t seem to realize what it
means to have two husbands at the same time!”</p>

<p>“How do I know if I’d <em>be</em> having two? How could I be
sure? How do I know where I stand anyhow? How do I
know where my husband is, or if I have any husband by this
time any more at all—even one?”</p>

<p>Lili in her pink dress and overloaded hat, with the little
dog straining and pouncing at the end of its leash, seemed
really an almost tragic figure. There was something so
petitioning, so frankly primitive about her outburst.</p>

<p>“You’re just as cosy as an iceburg, Jerry,” she said, even
simulating a small shiver. “You seem to forget all about that
night—you know—about us being together at Hilo, and how
you loved me then. Oh, my Gawd!” she ended in a lamentation
of moist bitterness. “It shows you can’t believe a
word a man says to you, and I just think I’ll go and commit
suicide!” After which she seemed to feel almost cheerful.</p>

<p>And then—then something most unexpected happened!</p>

<p>Just as she was saying, with a weak little resigned sigh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
that she’d have to be getting aboard, a dapper man in a check
suit came up and tipped his hat.</p>

<p>Lili brightened amazingly. Her manner grew excited and
gracious. She began beaming.</p>

<p>“Oh, here you are now!” she laughed. “I was looking for
you, and waiting till I didn’t dare wait any longer for
fear of missing the boat. I want to introduce you to Mr.
Stewart, an old friend of mine,” she went on cordially. And
now she was beaming on them both. It was a situation!</p>

<p>The newcomer, whose name Jerome didn’t get exactly,
shook hands, with some slight asperity, and began edging up
toward Lili in a faintly proprietary way. All at once
Jerome noticed that Lili’s wedding ring had mysteriously disappeared;
and from that time on he grinned without ceasing
until Lili and the new friend she’d picked up and the little
prancing dog had moved off out of sight round the corner.
Her friend was going on to Yokohama too. “On to Yokohama!”</p>

<p>“Can you beat it?” muttered Jerome.</p>

<p>And then, with just one brief sigh, he went about his own
affairs.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">It was a new phase of life entirely. The <i>Star of Troy</i> was
not the <i>Skipping Goone</i>; yet was, in her way, quite as
romantic. Jerome had a feeling from the very first that
the <i>Star of Troy</i> wasn’t altogether a typical tramp freighter.
She possessed a most remarkable captain, for one thing, and
a most remarkable captain’s daughter. Also there seemed
something cryptic about her whole destiny. The <i>Skipping
Goone</i> had always seemed like a nice, plump, amiable, sensible
old lady, whereas about the <i>Star of Troy</i> there was something
ageless, lithe, and alert, something unfathomable: the
very rush of water under her bow had a mysterious thrill behind
it. Here was a bow accustomed to explore strange
waters. Yes, the two craft were wholly alien creatures. Yet
Jerome found the subtler atmosphere of the taciturn, drab
tramp no less alluring. In place of the swishing sails and
the comfortable strain of rigging there was now the rhythmic
plod of an engine. He grew to love it. By all means there
was a wealth of romance here, if of a less garrulous and
gypsy sort, and the former clerk responded to it keenly—though
soberly, too, for the old Jerome was no more.</p>

<p>His talks with Captain Utterbourne held for him the fascination
of a piece of strange, vivid fiction. What a mine
the man was; what a life he lived! As for his life, no one but
Utterbourne himself could really know the full richness of it,
since with no one did he choose to share it save in flashes and
fractions.</p>

<p>The talk now largely centered about the project of the new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
Mediterranean experiment. But Jerome felt that although the
Captain might appear for a moment wholly engrossed in it,
even this venture, important and daring, even, as it might
seem, was but one venture out of a score, perhaps, with which
his brilliant mind was ever busy.</p>

<p>The evenings were rich and unforgettable, with the <i>Star of
Troy</i> slipping so steadily on through tropic seas and the little
white cabin, with the map of the world covering all one wall,
so cheerful and bright. They would gather here after dinner:
Utterbourne, Elsa, Jerome, and usually one or two of Utterbourne’s
men—Sutherland or Sargeant or maybe Rutherford,
keen-faced and clever, playing their parts in the
mysterious game about which no mind save one could really
know all. The China boy, smiling with his usual affectionate
understanding (though sometimes, too, with that more cryptic
smile which belongs to the unsearchable East) would mix
them suave, delicious drinks. And they would smoke and talk
of life in many climes and under all sorts of conditions. Captain
Utterbourne, whatever the theme, could hold them in a
thrall, when it pleased him. Sometimes he would elect silence.
But when he began to speak, the air took on a subtle
sparkle, though he was never guilty of mere wit.</p>

<p>And then, perhaps, the talk would turn to business—as it
generally did, sooner or later, with so much still in the air
which must be reduced to concreteness. And Elsa would
grow bored and pick up a novel, which she would read, or
pretend to read, with an air of languid absorption; or she
would leave them and go out alone on deck in the lofty dark
to dream of nobody knew what—dreams of her own, as profoundly
hidden away in the unassailable depths of her consciousness
as were the secret thoughts and broodings of the
Captain himself.</p>

<p>Jerome had many talks with Elsa, too, for the days were
long at sea, and each seemed glad of the other’s company.
It was upon these occasions that Jerome most surprised himself,
for they stirred in him a new and very pleasurable sense
of poise, which he had never even dreamed of acquiring in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
the days of his futile groping. He felt himself a match for
Elsa—not, however, that she didn’t frequently baffle him
with her drooping eyes and coolly static expression.</p>

<p>He looked forward to their talks together; and in her own
way, so did Elsa, too. Yes, perhaps in her own way Elsa
looked forward to them with even more eagerness than Jerome
himself. He interested her—particularly, she would tell
herself, in the light of what his past had been. She remembered
(and the picture kept rising in her mind) how she had
come upon him that afternoon in the street with Stella, and
how he had merely mumbled something and gone away. But
she remembered, too, how his shoulders had straightened,
as though unconsciously; and how she had felt, in her somewhat
psychic manner, that it would be the beginning of
better things for him. Then she had forgotten about him,
and here he was again. She had not guessed that his progress
would carry him so far in one short year.</p>

<p>Elsa discreetly (perhaps selfishly, too, without altogether
realizing it) refrained from any mention of Stella at first,
and Jerome never mentioned her, either. Yet, Stella was
sometimes in their minds as they talked. And one evening
she burst like a bomb on their ears. It was Utterbourne who
spoke of her. The <i>Star of Troy</i> was bound for San Francisco,
but there were to be stops: the Captain had already announced
something a little vague about picking up cargo somewhere
in the Chagos archipelago. Bluntly, at length, he turned
to Elsa and said:</p>

<p>“By the way, we’re likely to run into one of your old
friends.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dad?”</p>

<p>“She married Ferdinand King and they came out here to
settle. Or have I told you all this before?”</p>

<p>“No, dad. It’s quite fresh news—except her marriage.
If you remember, I was the maid of honour. Otherwise
you’ve not repeated yourself,” replied his daughter dryly.</p>

<p>Jerome had a strong feeling of unreality. The news
stabbed him with amazement. Yet after all it was only simple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
and natural that news of her at last should fall from the
Captain’s lips. He found himself musing in many moods.</p>

<p>“What in the world do you suppose they can be doing ’way
off here?” asked Elsa the next afternoon, as she and Jerome
sat together under a bit of awning aft. “Did you hear the
Captain say what island it is?”</p>

<p>“No. He said the Chagos group. I’m trying to recall
what’s raised there.”</p>

<p>“Guava, I suppose,” said Elsa. “Or copra.”</p>

<p>“Mr. King must have been put in charge of some business.
Perhaps he oversees output from the whole archipelago,”
remarked Jerome with somewhat expansive generosity.</p>

<p>“Like a prince, in a way, didn’t you always think him?”
ventured Elsa, her eyes darting toward him for a moment,
but her expression otherwise supremely uncompromising.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m hardly a judge of princes,” Jerome fenced
back.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean—a sort of fabulous prince, you know,” she
persisted. “Almost too good to be true.” Jerome laughed
easily, and she went on: “His beauty, as I recollect it, was of
that tremendous sort that leaves the whole world gasping as it
passes by. I was conscious of it in church, during the ceremony.”
And she added: “Were you there?” with another
of her little exploring darts.</p>

<p>“At the church? Yes,” he answered carelessly. “I slipped
in at the last minute, and stayed well back.”</p>

<p>Elsa gazed at him fixedly a moment, then observed: “Mr.
King always reminded me a little of some Roman emperor,
though which one I never figured out. Then he’s struck me
as perhaps Apollo, with the soul of Sir Willoughby!” She
laughed.</p>

<p>“You may be right,” her companion shrugged. “I barely
met him once. I took him to be the type most women would
fall for.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t a very high opinion of us, I’m afraid, as a
sex, Mr. Stewart.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t let my sweeping remarks lead you astray,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
he said, his eyes coolly mirthful, and a new look of cynicism
about his mouth.</p>

<p>“You mean you’re willing to allow there might be exceptions?”
It wasn’t, perhaps, entirely clear, but that was Elsa’s
way.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course,” he laughed.</p>

<p>“That would give us common ground to meet on, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Then you glory in being an exception?” He seemed eager
to play up to her mood—almost inspired to a sort of transient
cleverness.</p>

<p>“Oh, naturally,” replied Elsa, her eyes drooping as she
gazed off past him at nothing at all. “Just the way Tinker
Bell gloried in being an ‘abandoned little creature.’ One
lives and learns. Doesn’t one?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” After all, the plain monosyllable held still a place
in his soul.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re an exception, too,” she said, “if the subject
isn’t becoming too vague with handling.”</p>

<p>“I believe we’re two of a kind,” he told her, with a real
little flare of daring. There seemed a curious romantic gleam
in the situation. “I’ve had my flings and learned my lessons,”
he admitted.</p>

<p>She mused. “Yes. Still, it’s perhaps best to rap on wood,
don’t you think?”</p>

<p>Jerome made a careless gesture. “Oh, I’m not worried.”</p>

<p>“Still,” she went on in her utterly unmoved way, “the world
is a swarm of temptations, and the man who feels most secure
is usually just the one to be twisted round some woman’s
finger—or vice versa, of course. You understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand.”</p>

<p>In fact, they both understood. And in fact it seemed to
them as they talked that there was rather a good deal of
common ground. It was not an unpleasant discovery.</p>

<p>“I’d always said,” she went on, “I’d had my flings and
learned my lessons too. But I’m not superstitious, and I
never rapped on wood. Well,” she smiled, her brown eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
drooping a little more, “it would have been better if I had.
For I was taken in, after all. I almost reached the point of
parroting ‘I do’ in the presence of a rector. But I escaped in
time, which is something,” she ended seriously, her wise young
mouth taking on a singularly compact look.</p>

<p>He would have preferred, and really very much preferred,
remaining unenmeshed in Elsa Utterbourne’s eyes. But it
occurred to him that candour, in a case of this sort, might be
the wisest course. Her own passionless frankness encouraged
him, and he muttered: “I was taken in, too. But with me the
case went a little harder.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t escape in time—that’s all.”</p>

<p>She gazed at him with renewed interest, her foot tapping
slowly against the rail. “I didn’t know that,” she murmured.
And, since he didn’t spontaneously enlarge upon the interesting
announcement, as she hoped he would, the girl presently
asked him: “Would you like to talk about it? If you
wouldn’t, please say so. I’ll never mention it again.”</p>

<p>He laughed, shortly and with some bitterness. “It won’t
be necessary to do much talking. It was just something that
came about. The moon was partly responsible, but I don’t
care to lay the blame on any one but myself.”</p>

<p>“Some one in the troupe?” Elsa ventured.</p>

<p>“Yes. We didn’t get on together. She’s on her way to
San Francisco now—and freedom,” he replied, with quiet
significance.</p>

<p>“I see,” she said.</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and they shared between them a complex
smile.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>There were times when you felt you could safely disregard
what the Captain was saying, and go your way,
for he was by no means a tyrant or martinet. On the
other hand, there were now and then occasions when he said
something one knew instinctively must be regarded. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
more the inflection than the substance—or maybe just a faint
lifting of the chilly, flickering eyebrows.</p>

<p>At any rate, when the Captain suggested to Elsa that she
stay on board that evening with her novel and not attempt to
explore the island until morning, she knew this to be one of
the times. Shrugging her shoulders, she drawled:</p>

<p>“All right, Captain. It’ll be too dark by the time we get in
to see the sights.” And added, a little languidly: “This
doesn’t seem the liveliest of ports.”</p>

<p>“No. There’s an embargo on oil, and the natives have never
heard of electricity. Mr. Rutherford, I’d cut down a little
more. We can afford to creep here. There’s a legend about
reefs, and you know,” he added, with a graceful gesture in
the direction of the cabin where he kept his library of sailing
directions, “even the best of our charts weren’t drawn by God
Almighty.”</p>

<p>Though the restriction passed no further, and though he
was secretly prodded with curiosity to see what sort of place
this was to which Stella had come with her fabulous husband,
Jerome announced to Elsa that he, too, would wait until
morning to go ashore. He would stay and keep her company—unless
she really preferred her book.</p>

<p>This pleased her, though she didn’t, of course, show it. It
was interesting to come across a young man apparently quite
as disillusioned as herself, and one who never attempted even
abstractly, to make love to her. That, indeed, was the beauty
of the whole arrangement, on both sides. Each felt as the
other did about life, and especially about the opposite sex
and romance and moonlight and all that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Jerome smiled easily as he suggested she might prefer her
book, and Elsa—well. Elsa would very greatly have preferred
him to her book; but she felt, too, just the way he did: that
is, had penetrated beyond the tiresome realm of feeling
altogether; so that; after all, at the last moment she made
him go along. There was, to tell the truth, a tiny and very
complex tremor of alarm in her enigmatic heart, and she
knew she must remain indifferent at all costs. Besides, since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
a restriction had been laid down, she found it irksome to face
the ordeal of waiting until morning for news of their mutual
friend. There were times when the Captain was a little
tedious.</p>

<p>Jerome, also, was very anxious to keep his new and hard-won
indifference intact; but since whether he went or waited
was a matter of very small consequence, he decided, on Elsa’s
request, to go. Captain Utterbourne and two or three officers
were about to embark in the little launch. Jerome ran
and joined the shore party. The whole of the way in
the Captain talked dreamily about the relative excellence of
Cuban and Haitian rum.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>It was quite dark when the launch crept up to the dock.
There seemed to be no lights on the island. A queer
sort of a place. And what was that spectral object that
resembled a crazy derrick? Rutherford turned an electric
flash upon it.</p>

<p>Suddenly a figure darted forward out of the dark and fell
at the Captain’s feet. It was Tsuda. He uttered at first a
high-pitched oriental lamentation. But a sharp word brought
him to his feet, and he stood there before them with bowed
head. Clearly it was not a joyous welcoming.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the Captain, his voice low and
commanding. The poet and dreamer were now wholly
merged in the dynamic man of action.</p>

<p>“Evil come upon us!” Tsuda cried, his nervous brown
hands writhing.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let’s have any of your bizarre but redundant
embroideries now, Tsuda. What do you mean by evil?”</p>

<p>“Death,” said Tsuda between his teeth.</p>

<p>It was all very weird, with the dark, and the mysterious
background of tropical vegetation. But the sky was gradually
growing lighter, and in a little while the moon would
be up.</p>

<p>“Who is dead?” demanded Utterbourne sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>“It is the wife of the Kami....”</p>

<p>“Mrs. King—!” This was one of those rare occasions
when the man of many shrouds found himself betrayed into
a really spontaneous exclamation. He added quickly: “When
did it happen?”</p>

<p>“About a week ago, Captain.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>“Just fell sick of watching,” replied Tsuda simply, and
with the faintest suggestion of reproach in his voice, as though
he would like delicately to fix a slice of the responsibility
on the shoulders of his inquisitor.</p>

<p>And Utterbourne, though he ignored the reproach, seemed
to comprehend. “My God,” he said very softly, under his
breath. But already his mind was grappling with possibilities,
some of which might be realities, beyond this fact. “Where’s
King?” he asked with the former terseness.</p>

<p>Tsuda hesitated, as though delicately loath to be the bearer
of so much ill news. “The White Kami,” he muttered at
length, “lies—gn—in a trance, Captain. We can’t rouse him
much any more. Yet sometimes he cry out about the ogres.
They are still go on, you know, yes <em>sir</em>, even if Raikō—”</p>

<p>“That’s enough!” exclaimed Utterbourne almost savagely,
though still in a very low voice. “I tell you it’s no time for
your prattle about the gods. Where is King?”</p>

<p>“In the great house, Captain.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by saying he’s in a trance? Do you
mean—opium?”</p>

<p>“Sss,” replied Tsuda, and was still.</p>

<p>Captain Utterbourne thrust out his hands and gripped
Tsuda’s arms—felt the man tremble in his clutch.</p>

<p>“If all this isn’t the truth, let’s have it now. Otherwise it
will go hard with you later.”</p>

<p>Utterbourne was a man who, when a situation seemed perfectly
simple, could make it appear obscure and devious, but
who, if a situation was full of doubt and mystery, could speak
out bluntly from the shoulder.</p>

<p>“No, no—the truth!” cried Tsuda. “By all the shrines of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
Shinshū...!” And in a moment he added: “The White
Kami is fall on evil ways, Captain.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. King?”</p>

<p>“We bury her—gn—near the temple, on holy ground with
the rest that have die.”</p>

<p>A stillness followed, then Utterbourne asked:</p>

<p>“What are those lights moving along there through the
trees?”</p>

<p>Tsuda replied: “Every night send up offering to the temple
for the soul of Wife-of-the-Kami. She fall sick of watching,
but now the gods are good to her,” he murmured cryptically.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. The breathing of all the group
was faintly audible.</p>

<p>Jerome, at the first words concerning Stella, had turned
very pale. What this talk of a kami was he couldn’t fathom.
But he had known with the vividness of lightning that the
wife of the Kami meant Stella, and that Stella was dead. He
felt dazed. For anything but this he had been prepared.
Now he seemed completely cut adrift, and could scarcely
think. It seemed a new vortex in his life. Half an hour ago
this would have seemed impossible, but now he felt himself
carried away by a rush of emotion he could not understand.
Married and happy, Stella could never have meant more to
him than a troubled dream; dead of unhappiness, she took
possession of his heart and wrung it.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>“We’ll go on to your house, Tsuda,” said Captain Utterbourne
more gently, “and get to the bottom of this business.”</p>

<p>Tsuda nodded and led the way. The Captain turned back
with a muttered remark to one of his men: “I had an uneasy
feeling there was something wrong here. Places send out
strong waves of vibration.”</p>

<p>It was, in truth, these same “waves” which had whispered
him to take the one slight precaution of keeping Elsa on
board till the situation had been traversed. As a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
fact, one of the sly, unspoken objects back of his acquiescence
in Elsa’s request to come along with him on this voyage had
been the thought that her presence here would have a stimulating
and reassuring, a sort of bolstering effect on Mrs.
King. If she had grown lonely and discontented, Elsa would
cheer her and (with perhaps a little judicious manipulation)
convince her that it would be much easier now to face out
another year on the island. If King was doing well it would
be a pity to let him slip on to other fields just yet.</p>

<p>But the Captain had felt strangely uneasy, from the moment
the anchor dropped; and he preferred that Elsa be held temporarily
in reserve. As a recruit, Jerome, also, was a little
new. But Utterbourne was anxious not to strike any wrong
notes of unnecessary secrecy with him just now, and besides
wanted him to get more or less the “feeling” of these adventures,
which would help his background. Backgrounds were
very important things. He little guessed the commotion in
Jerome’s mind at the present moment.</p>

<p>A step or two farther along, Captain Utterbourne remembered
he had neglected to bring out a small chest of bright
trash which Tsuda would pounce on eagerly—gay, valueless
objects that would fit into his scheme of Ainu culture. Possibly
the chest might tend to put Tsuda in a frame of mind
for withholding nothing. Men like Tsuda had to be treated
tenderly. The trouble with Tsuda was that he was too
suspicious. Tsuda would be suspicious of a fly if it happened
to look a little different from most other flies.</p>

<p>“Would you mind, Sargeant, going back for it now—h’m?”</p>

<p>So the party temporarily disbanded. Utterbourne and
Sutherland went on with Tsuda, while Sargeant and Rutherford
turned back toward the launch.</p>

<p>At this moment of disruption a wild and romantic design
entered Jerome’s head and captured it entirely. In the dark
he made his escape from both parties. Utterbourne supposed
he had gone back with Sargeant, while the returning men
thought he had gone on with Utterbourne—or rather no one
gave him any deliberate thought at all. But Jerome, dodging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
behind a huge palm, waited until the steps in both directions
had died out.</p>

<p>Alone on an unknown island he stood, his heart given over
to a sudden wave of impulse. Stella was dead. In life their
ways had been roughly sundered; in death she seemed, during
this feverish, pulsing hour, given back to him again. He
seemed to have achieved an intangible victory over the man
who had once cast him into a humiliating discard—yes, all
in the first, swift, terrible knowledge of her fate.</p>

<p>He would go alone to her grave—he would be the first to
look upon it. Perhaps the others would not even go, since
after all what is a grave? But he would go; it was his hour
of triumph. Life had divided their ways, but death had
brought them together again. Poor Stella. Things had
turned out very differently with her from what she had hoped.
Probably no one would ever know just what had taken place.
She became starry with mystery and bound up in an eternal
beauty of suspense. Yes, he would go to her grave; for despite
what he had become, Stella must always be in his mind
the woman he once loved. Indifference, while it may carry
a man far, can never quite blot out a memory like that.</p>

<p>During the preceding sombre conversation he had caught
at words as they fell, almost without heeding them at the
time. Now they hung together in his mind and formed a
vivid picture. The grave was near the temple ... you could
tell it by the fresh flowers. And the string of lights ...
they were taking up an offering ... an offering to heathen
gods for the soul of Stella. It was ghastly. It all but passed
belief.</p>

<p>Keeping his distance, and walking as softly as possible,
Jerome made off after the procession of twinkling lights.
Overhead the heavy tropical stars were shining brightly.
There would be a moon presently; the east was aglow; but
in the jungle it was very dark. The way was long, and the
strange men with the lights went ever on ahead.</p>

<p>After a time a tropical grove was reached, in whose midst
stood the temple. No one, at first, approached very close:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
there seemed a recognized margin of some sort, beyond which
the ground was holy. Of them all, the single figure alone,
bearing in his hands a woven tray heaped with the choicest
fruits of the place, went on toward the temple itself; the rest
squatted upon the ground. Not a word was spoken. It was a
strange and awful ceremony.</p>

<p>The moon was just rising, full and yellow; the first soft
beams began to steal in through the breeze-stirred palm
orchard to illumine the temple with a pale light. But the
resinous torches cast up everything in bold, dancing relief.
Jerome, on the outskirts, crouching, felt his mind in greater
tumult even than before. He seemed to himself almost
possessed.</p>

<p>It was a Japanese temple. They had ruined Tsuda’s chances
of becoming a priest; but he knew a temple from <i>torii</i> to
<i>sessha</i>. It was surrounded by a low wall with a gate. Outside
the gate was a tiny spring of fresh water. Jerome could
see it: a little pool just troubled in the torchlight.</p>

<p>All about sprang the rich blackness of a tropical growth,
the most lush he had ever beheld. The moon was climbing
slowly up the sky. He was glad he had come. Life was wonderful
and sad. He watched with eyes that tried to record
every detail of this unearthly hour.</p>

<p>The figure with the offering uttered a bit of weird chanting;
then suddenly the words ceased, and the tray was deposited on
a small altar at the foot of a flight of steps leading up to the
temple itself. That was all. The crude fragment of ritual
concluded, these strange beings with bushy hair and prodigious
drooping moustaches moved away in silence. Jerome,
crouching in his hiding place, watched them pass by, one by
one, and disappear. He could see the twinkling lights, like
far-off tapers, winding farther and farther. Then silence was
supreme.</p>

<p>He remained still in hiding what seemed to him a long,
long time. Never had he been in a place so intensely still.
When at length he stirred and began moving cautiously toward
the temple, his senses were abnormally alert with the painful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
excitement. But he was ever conscious, too, of that odd feeling
of triumph in his heart. Death had seemed to put her
back somehow into his hands again. He couldn’t get away
from that thought—nor did he want to get away from it. Jerome
even began projecting, vaguely and fitfully, a scene with
Stella’s father: he would go in very simply and tell him how
he had visited her grave alone tonight.</p>

<p>The past was irrevocably behind them; but his heart would
not be still.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped, thrilling with terror, as a great bird
rose up from almost beneath his feet and flew off screaming
across the silvered dark. It looked like a great sinister eagle,
yet it had the neck of a crane and head plumage of what
(though moonlight can create delusion as regards colours)
seemed brilliant vermilion. He could hear the bird still
screaming at a great distance, crashing on through the
tangle of its native wood as though quite blind. After that
the silence was still more poignant.</p>

<p>Pulling himself together, Jerome moved on slowly, seeking
the grave with the flowers. There were a number of mounds
all about, but they looked ancient. Far around to one side,
however, he found at last the grave he sought—in the dark
stumbled against it, and was really on his knees before he
realized this was, in truth, the end of his quest.</p>

<span class="smaller">PITCHERS AND STARS</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Moonlight filled the open space and flooded the
temple with a bath of bluish white.</p>

<p>Jerome knelt beside the grave in the shadow of
great palms. In the midst of this world of silence he suddenly
felt a little self-conscious. Impulse, he feared, had carried
him to lengths which it would be rather difficult to explain.
Yet she was the woman he had loved, and men can never forget
these things.</p>

<p>“I must go back, now,” he thought.</p>

<p>Slowly he raised his eyes, and was glad of the stars and
the moon. It required the stars and the moon and the pounding
of one’s own heart at a time like this to keep a man sane.
He clung, rather, to the familiar, static facts in his life—a life
now so changed, which had once been packed with all that was
familiar and unchanging.</p>

<p>Stella lay dead at his feet, and on the little altar out there
in the moonlight was the offering placed at the threshold of
the gods for Stella’s soul. He bowed his head a moment,
shaken with amazement and confused regret. When he raised
his head, however, and was about to take his departure, Jerome
started. He fancied he had seen something stir in the
moonlight. In another moment he was sure of it.</p>

<p>The paper door of the temple was slowly moving. His
finger nails gripped hard against his palms, and he braced
himself by another swift glance at the unheeding dome of
night.</p>

<p>Yes, the door of the temple was opening—slowly, very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
slowly; first only a hair’s breadth, then wider and wider, till
the aperture was sufficient to permit a slender, white-clad
form to slip through and out into the soft radiance of the
night.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant object-lesson in the science of attention.
Quakes might have riven the earth, and he would have gazed
on, through the space of that first electric moment. Jerome
trembled violently, felt the cold sweat of terror and unbelief
on his forehead. His eyes beheld her—yet how could it be
she? His mind seemed suddenly crazed. He had been
through too much in one little hour, he reasoned, and closed
his eyes. When he opened them again she would be gone:
there would be only the moonlight on the silent temple, and
he would go back to the <i>Star of Troy</i> and take up his life
once more.</p>

<p>But the white figure was still before him. And then, like
a dart of dazzling inspiration, he knew this was really she,
and no creature of disordered fancy. Yet all the while he
knelt on her grave and could not move or speak.</p>

<p>She looked quickly about and listened. Jerome caught
something intimate and familiar in the tilt of her head. In
their old eventless lives she had tilted her head just that way,
sometimes. He was rigid while the girl very cautiously
crept out on to the steps of the temple and descended to the
shrine where the offering had been placed.</p>

<p>Her movements were nervous and stealthy. At the foot
of the flight she paused to look about and listen. Then, in an
abrupt, snatching way, she seized some of the food and ran
back up the steps with it, disappearing into the temple.
After a moment she reappeared, and this time moved as
though actuated by a slightly less acute nervousness—even
lingered a moment to gaze up, in a tense lost way, at the
beauty of the night sky. Then she was gone.</p>

<p>It was a time of breathlessness for Jerome, indeed. A
time of uncanny, prickling faintness. He trembled. The
emotion seemed almost unbearable. Yet he knew she was
Stella; and the former romantic appreciation of melancholy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
triumph was giving way to the chaos foreshadowing readjustment.
It was a time of incredulous certainty. A time
when fresh sensation seemed to overwhelm all the previous
sensations of a lifetime. It was no time for speculation,
however; how she came there while he knelt on her grave—what
it all meant—must wait. The only concrete issue that
really mattered was whether she would emerge again. If not,
what should he do? But if she did come out? He could
call to her—run and touch her—last frantic doubts—to see if
she were real. Still, the fright of it for her.... Well,
what then?</p>

<p>A suspicion hackneyed and shiny from human usage
clutched at his reason almost comfortingly: “I guess I’ll wake
up in a minute!”</p>

<p>She came, carrying a small stone pitcher—came down
quickly and crossed the enclosure to the spring beside the tiny
gate, where she stopped. Jerome’s mind, laying about feverishly
for some piece of subterfuge whereby his presence might
be made known without causing her any alarm, yielded nothing
but confusion. There must be some way—he ought to
be enough of an adventurer and man of the world by this
time.... Yet after all he could only stay where he was and
call her name—a little more gently and indeed reverently than
quite consorted with his new creed of woman-hating.</p>

<p>“Stella!”</p>

<p>Hardly more than a murmur, though it seemed to boom and
echo, as a voice will under stress of an unusual silence.</p>

<p>She cried out and fled back to the little flight of steps; but
he came forward, an arm outstretched.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, Stella. I’m Jerome.”</p>

<p>And he stopped, stood still where he had emerged from
shadow into the moonlight.</p>

<p>She could see him distinctly. She was grasping the pitcher
of water with both hands—not that it was the last pitcher in
existence, nor that she was so very much concerned about the
water, for there was ever so much more of it; she clung to the
pitcher, rather, the way Jerome had been clinging to the heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
bodies. There had to be something perfectly regular,
like pitchers or stars, to keep hold of.</p>

<p>But when she saw it really was Jerome, she sat down very
limply on the top step and did a tremendously natural thing:
she began crying—tears that had burned long, unreleased,
when she had thought there were no more tears left.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Inside, the temple was just a single tiny room with an altar
against the far wall. The altar was a crude affair, with a
“holy of holies” containing an undersized image of the goddess
Amaterasu. Two small windows high up let in the moonlight.
Still, it was so dark after the comparative brightness
without that at first it was possible to distinguish very little.
Stella drew the paper door back across the opening through
which they had entered. After that, to the outer world the
temple presented its usual blank and uninhabited look.</p>

<p>“We must be quiet,” she said, her voice much shaken with
terror and tears. “Shall we sit down on the floor?”</p>

<p>The gleam of hysterical wildness in her eyes cautioned him
she must be humoured; and he realized, too, that as yet she
knew none of the particulars behind his presence. What an
amazing situation it was—what an amazing proposition life
was, anyhow, that it should evolve such moments as this under
an unperturbed sky, and with everything else about the universe
intact....</p>

<p>They sat there facing each other on the floor, in the centre
of the temple to the goddess Amaterasu, and at first the immense
strangeness of it all put a restriction upon speech:
there was so much to be asked and so much to be answered
that a sense of painful self-consciousness played conspirator
with the so slowly subsiding shock of this coming together—out
of a void, as it were.</p>

<p>When at last she spoke, it was in a tense whisper: “Did
you come in the <i>Star of Troy</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank God!” He heard her wildly sobbing again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>“Have you been expecting Captain Utterbourne a long
time?”</p>

<p>“August,” she faltered, “—then in February. It’s over a
year—two long months over a year.... Since coming to
live in the temple, I’ve lost all count of the days. Is this
Friday?”</p>

<p>“No, Thursday, Stella.”</p>

<p>“Thursday,” she murmured after him, her voice strained
and colourless. Then she clasped her hands suddenly and
asked in tones verging upon shrillness: “How did you find
your way, Jerome?”</p>

<p>“They told us you were dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead?” It was a repetition choked with bewilderment.</p>

<p>“When we came ashore the Japanese met us—”</p>

<p>“Tsuda!” Her breath caught sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tsuda.”</p>

<p>And in the same swift instant Jerome shared her vivid
grasp of the situation. They sat in silence, both stunned by
the terror of it.</p>

<p>“What did Tsuda say?” she asked him presently, her voice
so low he could just make out the words.</p>

<p>“He said ‘evil’ had come. And when Captain Utterbourne
asked him what he meant by that, he said: ‘Death.’ And
then he said: ‘The wife of the Kami.’ Why do they call him
that?”</p>

<p>“My husband...?” she murmured, her tone groping and
lifeless. “They call him the White Kami here. It’s too
terrible to speak of!”</p>

<p>A vague little gesture, and her hand fell limp.</p>

<p>Yes, all too terrible. Religion and saké. And the daughter
of a harness merchant who had married in a mood of such
unreasoning exuberance, with relief from the humdrum of
her life so eagerly grasped, was reduced at length to dwelling
in a Shintō temple, while the Master Mind dallied with a fine
intellectual passion over such theses as the failure of civilization,
and laid plans for bringing down perhaps a rhinoceros
or two in the realm of the raja....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>“But why are you here in this temple?” Jerome asked.</p>

<p>“It’s such a long, long story,” she quiveringly sighed, while
again the hysterical sobs shook her violently.</p>

<p>He felt her misery across the dark.</p>

<p>After a time she grew a little coherent. “I had to come
here, Jerome—I had to. My husband....” The words
faltered, though he heard her still thickly murmuring, like
one in a fever.</p>

<p>Then he remembered. “I know,” he said softly. “They
spoke of that, too, Stella....”</p>

<p>Yes, they had spoken of that. But they did not know (except
Tsuda) how in one of his frenzies King had attacked her
with a knife; and not even Tsuda knew that the knife had
actually entered her body. But Tsuda had seized upon King’s
madness as an admirable and timely pretext for insisting
upon the hospitality of the gods.</p>

<p>Through one of the little high windows Jerome could see
the moon, mounting in sublime unconcern. There is something
always so utterly calm and unhurried about the moonlight.</p>

<p>Stella’s face was brimming with anguish, and she seemed
ever in motion: her fingers kept lacing and fumbling—sometimes
she would fold her hands and bow her head over them
in an attitude of helpless submission. But only for a moment.
Her head would be raised with a start, and she would
run a hand through her hair, or make an aimless gesture,
if she chanced to be speaking. Her voice, too, had an unresting
quality. It sounded a note of suffering, and of an
immense sadness deeper still, which had certainly never been
there in the old days when she had rebelled against her destiny.
It was a new note, vibrating, as it were, across the
tissue of her very being.</p>

<p>She inclined her head. “No one will ever know, Jerome,
what I’ve gone through.”</p>

<p>He grasped at it with unconscious avidity. Had he realized,
in a perfectly bald way, how he felt, he would no doubt
have been a little horrified. But in the very depths of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
heart—that is to say, in the very depths of his ego—Jerome
found curious, sweet comfort in the knowledge that her marriage
with this other man, this prince (as Elsa called him,
with drooping eyes) had at length proved a thing of reproach
and bitterness.</p>

<p>“And Tsuda....”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, her eyes quite wide with this new terror
in her heart. “It was Tsuda who brought me here. He told
me I’d be safe. There were times before.... But he said
this would be a sanctuary, and that I’d be quite safe with the
gods. You have to know Tsuda to understand all this.”</p>

<p>“But <em>you</em> could not have known Tsuda, really,” observed
Jerome with narrowness of tone, his voice grown steady and
cool now, and a shade aloof.</p>

<p>“He seemed to be my only friend,” she said miserably.
“Oh, Jerome—if you knew everything.... As for the motive—it’s
too hideously plain, isn’t it? Tsuda arranged to have
offerings brought up in the evening. It was a part of his
religious observances. His brother was a priest, and Tsuda
would have been a priest too....” There was a wildly monotonous
quality in her speech. She was wringing her hands.</p>

<p>They were silent a moment, and then, seeming to grasp the
completeness of the irony, he muttered: “Those very offerings
that kept life in your body were part of a ritual over
your death...!”</p>

<p>She shuddered. “It was the grave of one of the Ainu! I
asked Tsuda why they were heaping flowers on it, and he said
it was a part of their religion—because the man had been
brought to his death by a spell....”</p>

<p>“If I hadn’t come here tonight,” said Jerome, solemn and
scarcely breathing, “the <i>Star of Troy</i> might have sailed off
again without your knowing!”</p>

<p>She gave a little sharp terrified cry, and he saw that the
matter must not be enlarged upon. Nevertheless, in his own
mind conjecture played with all the lurid possibilities. Even
had Utterbourne taken it into his head to come and look upon
the grave, Tsuda would have taken good care the girl in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
temple knew nothing of it. He saw Tsuda creeping up here
very early in the morning and putting her to sleep with something.
Tsuda.... The <i>Star of Troy</i> would have steamed
off. And after that....</p>

<p>But he merely asked, with an inflection of grimness, out of
the silence:</p>

<p>“Are you the only white woman here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jerome, the only one.”</p>

<p>Then she was very still. She was not weeping now.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>They would never know what she had endured. Yet her
hopes had once run so high.... Well, the pendulum swings;
and after all there are no favourites, except perhaps in a
whimsical or poetic sense.</p>

<p>Stella and Jerome, at the feet of the everlasting gods; and
irony sniffed and chuckled in the corners. Both were vividly
conscious of the play of forces in their lives, and of that immense
quality of change which, developed through the scenes
of the drama that had so capriciously caught them up, revealed
itself now in all they did and said.</p>

<p>Calmer, she asked him about his phase of the drama: how
had he come on the <i>Star of Troy</i> when she had left him irrevocably
in the rut of Oaks, Ferguson &amp; Whitley’s? And
he told her a little of his vast adventure, while her heart was
stricken with a curious confusion—partly, no doubt, because
of the aloof manner which, more and more, he was coming
to display toward her.</p>

<p>These were baffling days—and a queer, wrong-way-round
business life can be, she thought, when it has a mind. Jerome’s
reactions were rather simpler: Stella, alive and married
to another man, drifted back into the mere troubled
dream which the thought of her death had momentarily
broken.</p>

<p>“You’re making something really worth while out of your
life, aren’t you?” she said softly, yet in a voice still strained
from emotion; and her gaze, across the dimness of the temple,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
seemed compounded of incredulity, wistfulness, and a wild
despair. Occasionally a tiny sob still caught her breath.</p>

<p>Jerome smiled in his new worldly and rather cynical way.
“You mustn’t forget,” he generously reminded her, “that to
begin with I was carried off like a limp bag of meal!” And
then he gave her more details—without bothering, however,
to stick quite so close to all the facts as to make himself entirely
a comic figure, even in the beginning.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it strange, Jerome, how some of the last things we’d
ever think possible are the very things that do happen to us?”
Her hands, never still, stroked her cheeks aimlessly.</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that sometimes,” he answered. “I guess
it would never have struck any one as likely, a year or two
ago, that you’d end by marrying a man like Mr. King and be
carried off to an island to raise opium! And I guess,” he
went on impartially, with again the touch of grimness, “it
never struck us, either, that I was the kind of fellow who
would join an opera troupe and end by letting one of the
singers—take my name....” He never could seem quite to
bring it out baldly. He had evaded a little, also, with Elsa,
and had not used the actual word, though in the end, of
course, it amounted to the same thing.</p>

<p>“Married, Jerome? A singer...?”</p>

<p>Her eyes were all amazement and inquiry across the dusk
of the temple. But he tossed his head with a careless fling,
for he was fully revived now, and even if it was difficult,
circumstances being what they were, to make the announcement
with real and satisfying bravado, still he wanted her to
know that he, too, had had his taste of matrimony—though
he didn’t mention it had only been after a fashion....</p>

<p>She could hardly believe the things she saw and heard;
and she remembered how she had sent the ring back by Ted
without a message.</p>

<p>The moon climbed higher, and a tiny night wind was springing.
It made the tattered leaves of the palms and giant ferns
shiver softly, like rain. Stella felt his aloofness, and a shy
reticence came upon her tongue. She sat silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>“I guess we’ve both changed some,” Jerome laughed coolly,
assuming more lightness than he perhaps really felt. He was
a little ashamed of his very romantic state of mind an hour
ago.</p>

<p>“People couldn’t go through all we have in the past year
without changing.” Her voice reached the heart with its pathetic
deadness. The woman drooped and gently shook
before him.</p>

<p>Another silence, with the sad swish of the jungle outside,
under a white moon.</p>

<p>“Hagen’s Island,” she murmured brokenly after awhile, “is
a place where you come to know yourself through and
through.” And he saw still more vividly that this was not
the girl he had known in his groping days of hobbledehoy.
“I’ve tried to believe it would come right in the end,” she resumed
in a moment, “—maybe after a long, long time. But
all the while—” it faltered just a little—“all the while I’ve
had a feeling I’d never see home again.” Then she looked
up and spoke with a touch of hysterical brightness: “I used
to sit on the rocks, Jerome, and imagine what a home-coming
it would be! You don’t mind my rambling on like this, do
you Jerome?”</p>

<p>“Of course not.” But he was privately marvelling. Stella—great
Scott!—actually sighing over the thought of home,
where nothing ever happened! It made him smile—oh, ever
so worldly and sophisticated a smile; and he couldn’t help
remembering again how she used to sail into him in her impetuous,
young, rebellious way, for being so satisfied with
his humdrum lot.</p>

<p>“Jerome,” she said presently, in a voice it was obviously
a little difficult still to control, “you haven’t told me anything
about your wife.”</p>

<p>He made an indefinite sound with his lips, and a look half
of amusement, half of grimness, yet also somewhat of a
gentler sadness, came into his eyes. “No, I haven’t,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“Are you happy, Jerome?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>“Now? Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Where is she?”</p>

<p>“Where? Oh, off on the high seas somewhere. The fact
is,” he continued more bluffly, “we’ve separated, Stella. It
wasn’t a success. We bored each other. As Captain Utterbourne
would say, these experiments require a sort of real
genius if they’re not to turn out failures. I believe,” he added
with a sparkle, “the Captain speaks from experience.”</p>

<p>Stella looked at him, then her eyes faltered. There was an
immense confusion in her heart. All at once she, too, remembered
how she had scolded him so bitterly that afternoon
in the fog. “If I were a man,” she had cried with high,
impatient scorn, “I think I’d discover something besides being
a clerk in a dingy old ship supply store!” And now he
had discovered something besides that. He had discovered
another destiny altogether, and she could play no part in it.</p>

<p>She contemplated, as they sat together on the moonlit
temple floor, the tangle into which their lives had drifted.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Utterbourne sat with impassive face in the house
of Tsuda. Finally he said: “We will go to see
King.”</p>

<p>Nipek-kem went proudly on ahead with a lantern. He
did not know exactly what it was all about—he was just
faithfully fulfilling the demands of his destiny.</p>

<p>“I want you to see for yourself, Captain—gn—what I’ve
been up against here,” wheezed Tsuda, adding in high-pitched
oriental petulance: “For months every damn scrap of business
fall on me. He smoke ten—twenty—mebby fifty pipe a day—yes,
<em>sir</em>—and then sleep it off—and eat it, too, just like a
Malay. You see for yourself when you go in where he is—gn—what
a damn job I have of it!”</p>

<p>Utterbourne hummed and made no reply.</p>

<p>When they neared the house, Tsuda volunteered, a sad look
in his bright, equivocal eyes: “Last time I pay a friendly
visit, Captain, the White Kami throw a chair at me.” Tsuda
sighed and shook his long head. “The will of the gods—gn—something
we can’t understand....”</p>

<p>“The will of the gods,” mused Utterbourne, a little mystically.</p>

<p>“After that,” Tsuda added, “I keep my distance, you damn
bet! A man don’t care to risk his life—no, <em>sir</em>!” And he
cringed a little, the posture seeming subtly to add to the impressiveness
of his own earlier words—“what I’ve been up
against here.”</p>

<p>“Tsuda,” said Utterbourne dreamily, “what’s the name of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
this favourite son of his people who’s honouring us with the
lantern?”</p>

<p>“That is Nipek-kem, Captain.”</p>

<p>“Nipek-kem,” ordered Utterbourne, turning toward the
Ainu, “come here with the light a minute.”</p>

<p>The young savage stared. Tsuda uttered a few curt foreign
syllables, and then the Ainu bounded toward them.</p>

<p>“Nipek-kem,” suggested the Captain in his lazy drawl,
“please hold the lantern just here.”</p>

<p>Tsuda, vaguely alarmed, repeated the command in the crude
dialect of Paromushir. All his antennae were out. He sniffed
the psychic air between them.</p>

<p>The Ainu youth, his shirt royal with souvenirs of service,
like that of a general after a life of triumphant campaigns,
held the light where he was bidden to hold it.</p>

<p>Captain Utterbourne glanced round the circle, then murmured:
“I’ve been wondering, Tsuda, about that curious little
pouch at your belt. You never used to wear it.”</p>

<p>The two men stared at each other, striving to break through
those barriers which the Great Mother teaches her children
to throw up about their souls.</p>

<p>“That, Captain? Oh—gn—it’s—”</p>

<p>“Quite so, Tsuda. Nevertheless, I think you’d better give
us the gun.”</p>

<p>The duel of eyes continued, each holding the other. It
became more primitive from moment to moment.</p>

<p>“The gun, Captain?”</p>

<p>Not all his cleverness was quite equal to the task of maintaining,
in presence of this awful poker stare, a convincing
mask of innocence. His life might depend on his holding
the Captain’s eyes; but it was an ordeal beyond his powers.
He faltered. Suddenly, however, a great light broke across
the lined old face with its strangely youthful eyes, and he explained:
“It was a present—from Wife-of-the-Kami. I guess
what you call it—gn—a keepsake!” And he brought out
then, in triumph, the island’s only revolver, handling the little
weapon as a child would a cherished toy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p>The Captain didn’t fail to appreciate it all: the light of
triumph, the fondness; still he insisted, quietly but with an
undertone of iron firmness: “You’d better give it to Mr.
Sutherland. Keepsakes are sometimes dangerous, Tsuda. I
must have neglected to warn you.”</p>

<p>Tsuda shivered a little with terror and foreboding. However,
Captain Utterbourne made no further comment in this
connection.</p>

<p>“I’m going in alone,” the Captain said. “It might excite
Mr. King if we all descended upon him together. He might
think us some of Tsuda’s ogres—the Ogres of Oyeyama....
Sometimes frenzy carries them very far—h’m? There’s a story
told of an opium fiend in Java—or perhaps it was hashish,
I don’t remember. He ran amuck at Batavia and killed a
lot of people in the street before reserves arrived and he was
finally run through by a soldier. The strength of fiends in
certain stages—h’m?—it’s said to be sometimes enormous.
The fellow was run through with a pike, yet such still was
the desperation of the man that he—h’m?—he worked himself
forward on the pike, and when he got near enough, stabbed
the soldier to death with a dagger. Therefore—h’m?” the
Captain ended, “I will enter alone. But I will take the lantern
from Nipek-kem. Tsuda, will you assure this impressive
individual that he may safely trust the lantern in my hand?”</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>At first it was hard to make out much of anything in Mrs.
King’s “parlour.” A murk of opium smoke made the gloom
tangible. The lamp was not lighted. It had a crazy newspaper
shade now, and the chimney was streaked black. The
table on which it stood was cluttered with rubbish and
clumsily opened tins which had held meats and fish. The
whole place was foul, and the air was so thick it could only
be breathed with the greatest difficulty by lungs not inoculated.</p>

<p>From a corner of the room came the sound of measured
breathing. King was expelling opium smoke from mouth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
and nose. He seemed to be drawing up the smoke from the
very soles of his feet, and his eyes were closed in ecstasy—partly
immediate, but more depending upon a knowledge of
the sweet torment in store for him. There was another steady
intake from the pipe, another exhalation; and, the resources
of the pipe exhausted, it was laid aside. For a few moments
the inert man made feeble wafting motions in the air with
one hand.</p>

<p>And above him, on the wall, Captain Utterbourne perceived
a bright print of a sailor returned to his own fireside. Below
it was the last leaf of a calendar, with all the dates
blocked black. And beside it was a sheet of paper on which
several new months had been indicated with a pencil. He
seemed to realize what it meant with something faintly like
a flicker of emotion.</p>

<p>Utterbourne went to the man on the cot, leaned down over
him, and said, in a clear, loud voice:</p>

<p>“Mr. King!”</p>

<p>The crouching figure shuddered, and with a wretched,
baffled effort, tried to shake off the mounting lethargy. He
opened his eyes, wanly questioning, and at length managed to
stagger up from the cot.</p>

<p>King was meagrely clothed, and dirty—a sad object, all
in all, and a pretty far cry, now, from any reasonable conception
of a god.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he faced the newcomer with the lantern, a
light of frenzied recognition flamed in his face, making the
havoc there singularly vivid. He took a lurching step and
stretched out his arms, his eyes moving with obscured intelligence.</p>

<p>“Utterbourne!” he cried out in a terrible voice and flung
his arms heavily about the other’s neck, as a drunkard might.
“Good God, Utterbourne! What a hell to leave a man
in....” But it flickered weakly.</p>

<p>His cheeks were grey, and so far shrunk from their former
appearance as to resemble a tough, thin substance stretched
tightly over the bones of the face. He was afflicted with general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
marasmus or consumption of the flesh, and to look into
the man’s face now was almost like looking at a skull plastered
with smoked wax.</p>

<p>He bore down on Utterbourne’s shoulders, and a ray of
drifting content came into his eyes—eyes which began to
look even a little blue and round again, though the dull fire
of delirium made their expression still one of wreck and
hopelessness. The Captain manœuvred him back on to the
cot, pushing him with an arm that partly repelled and partly
supported. King dropped, an almost grateful little cry on
his lips, and for a while sat looking helplessly up at the
face bent down toward him, so unchanging.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know more about everything here,” said
Utterbourne, in a firm yet inviting voice.</p>

<p>“Yes?” answered King, his hands dangling forlornly.
“Yes?” And he gazed with vacant eyes in which the last
spark of fascination had long ago smouldered and gone out.
He had an odd way of swaying and dodging, occasionally
even raising an arm, as though to ward off some menace.
When he spoke it was in a clear but singularly detached
voice, and he seemed frequently to grope about for even the
most commonplace words.</p>

<p>“Will you sit down and—talk to me?” he implored. “You
don’t know—what did I start to say? You don’t know—what
it’s like to hear a white man speak again!”</p>

<p>“I will,” agreed the Captain quietly. “Let me light the
lamp. Where do you keep your matches?”</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to understand—very well. Would you mind
being a little more—a little more....” He swayed and his
eyes closed.</p>

<p>“Never mind. I have matches.” And in a moment the
lamp was lighted, though it did not materially relieve the
gloom of the place. Then Utterbourne sat down and spoke
King’s name again in loud, commanding tone.</p>

<p>“Mr. King!”</p>

<p>It smote against the silence ominously. Utterbourne, with
his life of multiple sensation, had perhaps never before found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
himself immersed in an atmosphere so profoundly sombre.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” muttered the swaying cadaver.</p>

<p>The Captain shook him, and the man on the cot made
another genuine effort to control his waning senses.</p>

<p>“I am—Ferdinand King,” he said, almost in a chanting
way. “I came out here to take charge of a—of a....”
He seemed to drift again and lose the thread.</p>

<p>“I know,” encouraged the other man.</p>

<p>“Opium! That was it! Sometimes it all seems—to fade
away. We were keeping it dark....” A sound like a rattling
chuckle drifted off his lips. Then his eyes gradually
filled with such a look of penetrating anguish that the Captain
shaded his own eyes and gazed at the tiny spirit flame beneath
its dome of glass. “Even my wife ...” murmured King.
It was a look, surely, that came from the very bottom of the
beaten man’s soul; and it takes a superhuman courage indeed
to behold such a look with no flinching.</p>

<p>Tears rushed from King’s eyes, and he went on murmuring:
“I had a wife once—a lovely girl—so pretty and gentle—but
perhaps you’ve seen her....” His voice was low, and he
went on more brokenly, rocking himself slowly back and
forth: “They say she has died. She seems—to be gone
away....” He struggled, his eyes moving vaguely. “Gone
away.... Oh, God help me!” he suddenly cried out with a
hollow yet considerable force. Then he grew dense and inaudible
again, though continuing to mutter, apparently under
the persuasion that he was still speaking intelligently.</p>

<p>Utterbourne, his glance roving about the dim sombre place,
caught sight of an uncased hunting knife on the table beneath
the lamp with its crazy shade. The knife had a menacing, a
naked look.</p>

<p>The man on the cot was babbling weakly, and to bring him
back once more to a state of coherency, Utterbourne spoke
with the former incision: “Look here, King!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve—come,” the other managed thickly, his
eyes gazing sadly out through tears that had pooled and
ceased flowing. “I was looking for you—there’s a big book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
over there—over there....” His arm waved with childish
vagueness. “I started in to write up—a report. There would
have been time....” He made a ghastly attempt to smile.
Then, “I’m afraid,” he drifted, “you’ll find it—not quite up
to date....”</p>

<p>Utterbourne perceived the book, down on the floor under
a mantle of dust. He crossed, curious, and took it up. The
first hundred pages or so were filled with a flowing and elegant
penmanship, but toward the end the writing had grown shaky
and rough. The last entry was dated November 17.</p>

<p>“In a little while,” muttered King nebulously, “I’m going—on
with it....” When Utterbourne returned he found him
examining his nails with close attention. Now and then he
rubbed his palms together gently. The tears that lay splashed
on his cheeks already were emblems of an emotion so ancient
that the wretched man had forgotten it, almost as though
through eons of Brahmic life.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes.... What was I saying? About the crop?
We’ve been—very successful—but I hope another year....”
He dozed and came to. “I say I hope we’ll be able to put up—a
tank for the rains so we can irrigate. Then you see ...
I don’t know.... Does that answer your question?”</p>

<p>“King,” said the Captain sadly and a little dryly, “how did
you come to fall for your own goods?”</p>

<p>The other looked up wanly and again tried to smile. It was
long before he comprehended what had been said, but at
length he began murmuring: “I really can’t say—no, I can’t.
It seems—such a long time....” And after another somnolent
pause he asked: “What did I say?”</p>

<p>“We won’t go into it tonight,” sighed Captain Utterbourne,
rising heavily. “Go to sleep, King. In the morning we’ll
try to get at more of the facts.”</p>

<p>Then a look of groping alarm came into the face of the
White Kami, and he began beating his hands together. “I
wish you wouldn’t go away!” he pleaded. “Only a little
while after you’re gone, they’ll begin to come in for the
night!” His eyes smouldered wildly. “Don’t go away just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
yet. I—I’ll see if I can answer your question—if you’ll
wait.” He beat his fists against his head, but rather coaxingly
than savagely. The veins stood out as he made a terrific effort
at concentration. “Yes!” His face lighted faintly. “It
was about the opium. Not the crop—no....” He shook his
head, as though patiently arguing with himself. “Me—me!
Wasn’t that what you wanted? At first—at first I used very
little. Yes—don’t go away! I’m—going to tell you how it
was. It was—Tsuda.... I guess he uses a little now and
then, too. Perhaps some day you’ll want to try—a jaunt.
In that case.... What was I saying? Did I say Tsuda?
Yes—that’s right. That’s right.... I kept telling myself,”
he rambled, his manner growing more and more agitated,
and wilder, with an inflection of impatience, “I’d <em>quit</em>—I’d
<em>quit</em>....” Then, his tone growing warm and dreamy, and
fresh tears springing to his eyes: “We were going to settle
down—in some little ... in some little place where nothing
much ever happens—but it seems sometimes—<em>no, don’t go!</em>
I try to hold on, and my fingers ... my fingers keep slipping
off....” He regarded his fingers ruefully, flexing them at
the joints in a childish way. His expression grew very dull
and hopeless. “The lamp,” he muttered. “Would you mind—looking?
I’m afraid the oil’s very low.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, King,” said Utterbourne huskily. “In the
morning....”</p>

<p>But he paused in his departure, and saw with amazement a
look of swift and convulsing terror leap into the other’s eyes.
It was almost as though flames darted from them, as King
cried:</p>

<p>“In at the windows and doors—they’ll come—all of them—together!”</p>

<p>And he sprang up, screaming. He beat at the air with mill-like
motions, his eyes starting from his head in an ecstasy of
horror. He darted over to the table and seized the knife.
His cries were the kind that must live on forever. As he approached
Utterbourne, he raised the knife tremblingly in the
air, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span></p>

<p>“If you try to leave me—I’ll kill you!”</p>

<p>A slight movement at the door—Utterbourne’s officers, together
with Tsuda, were in the room. But Utterbourne merely
stood his ground, gazing hard at the frenzied being before
him, while he spoke again, in a ringing voice: “Mr. King!”</p>

<p>It seemed to have a calming and disarming effect. The
victim shivered and breathed in noisily. His threatening pose
dissolved, his arms dropping like pieces of flexible lead,
while the knife clattered harmlessly on to the floor.</p>

<p>King staggered, and a moment later was lying on the cot.
But he was not yet quiescent, for he beat at his hands furiously,
and bit them, drawing blood. Muffled cries came from
him on long sighs.</p>

<p>They beheld in his face a look of ravenous hunger. Presently
a hand trembled over to the tabouret, and with fluttering
fingers King took up the pipe. Even in this crazed and
moribund condition he seemed to know to an exquisite fineness
when the tiny browning ball had attained just the
proper pitch—never the least bit burned, never toasted a
shade too dry.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>It was perhaps not so startling as kneeling on her grave
and beholding her emerge from a temple; nevertheless, the
entrance of Stella a few minutes later was distinctly sensational.
Jerome came in just behind her—a situation complex in the
extreme. As was characteristic, Utterbourne adjusted himself
to it without the contraction or flurry of a single feature,
and in one of his sharp, enigmatic silences.</p>

<p>Tsuda, after the first stupefied moment, seemed to wilt
and shrink. He saw that he had been somehow outwitted.
He was lost—Tsuda knew that conclusively. He did not
dare look at the Captain, but stood where he was, shrinking,
trembling a little. The game was up—it had been a curious
conspiracy.... All at once he seemed to become a very
old man.</p>

<p>Stella barely paused as she entered the room and the wave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
of almost tangible amazement broke about her. She crossed
the room, her face white and unmoving, and dropped down
beside the cot. She did not lay her hands upon her husband,
but her words embraced him pityingly.</p>

<p>“Ferd—I’ve come back.”</p>

<p>The little spirit lamp was calmly alight, and she gazed at
it with eyes in which there was nothing but misery.</p>

<p>King’s lips moved, though there was no sound of words.
A look of ruined radiance shone in his face. Stella settled
in a little heap. Her head sank on to her arms, and she
uttered a soft, desperate cry.</p>

<p>The tragic tableau held the men about her in a state of
breathlessness.</p>

<p>“Mrs. King,” murmured Captain Utterbourne; and there
was an unmistakable element of thanksgiving in his voice.</p>

<p>He would have questioned her. But after all, there could
not be much to say. The little spirit lamp beside the cot,
and the pipe and dipper and the covered box seemed telling
the story over and over each time a glance fell upon
them.</p>

<p>Tsuda, shrunken and aged, moved almost imperceptibly
round to the door. He waited until the wife of the Kami
crumpled into a heap, and then, with the spell of motionless
tenseness broken, he saw his way clear to slipping out into
the night.</p>

<p>However, the gods, for whom he had always evinced so
lofty an affection, were not very kind to Tsuda. It was like
a run of ill luck in faro. Scarcely had he left the house,
when a furious beast sprang upon his shoulders and crushed
him to the ground under a storm of blows. The furious
beast had once been a quiet little clerk in Market street. But
much water had run under the bridge, and besides—the clerk
had lost his head completely.</p>

<p>He was magnificent and elemental. He was mad to taste
blood, and he pounded with the merciless hammer of fists
which possessed little science but their full quota of untrained
punishing power. One blow thrilled him profoundly. Tsuda<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
lurched back with a groan and thrust an arm across his eyes.
Then he, too, fought—furious and desperate, like a wounded
jaguar, using his teeth and nails freely, and butting with
his bullet-like Mongolian head. Tsuda had naturally known
something of defense in his younger days, for he had considered
it a good thing for a man to know how to take care
of himself, even if he did expect to be a priest. They
clinched and Tsuda neatly tripped his foe and they went down
together in a crashing sprawl.</p>

<p>But somehow, by sheer force of youth and recklessness,
probably, Jerome managed to capture both of Tsuda’s wrists.
The man’s muscles strained and quivered, while his lusty
opponent, with swift red passion in his eye now, bent to the
grip, his teeth grinding. The belligerent contact intoxicated
him. It was like his first champagne. It was the finishing
stroke of victorious manhood.</p>

<p>In this position he could have broken Tsuda’s arms, and
Tsuda knew it and cried out warningly. Never since the
ancient day in Nemuro, when he got into a row with miners
over a little dancing girl, had Tsuda been so tempestuously
set upon. This time the row was not over a geisha, but the
only white woman on Hagen’s Island.</p>

<p>Jerome felt Captain Utterbourne standing calmly yet a little
grimly above them.</p>

<p>“He can’t get away, Mr. Stewart. Release his arms.”</p>

<p>So Jerome sprang up, bloody and sweaty, and stood panting.
The heroic flash of melodrama was over.</p>

<p>And the Captain said: “We’ll take Tsuda aboard with us
tonight for safe-keeping; in the morning we’ll all feel more
rational. Mrs. King insists upon staying beside her husband,
but we can’t leave her without protection. Sargeant—”</p>

<p>But Jerome broke in: “I’m staying, please. We knew each
other once. We lived just around the corner from each other.
I’d rather not go back to the ship tonight.” It seemed a
magnificent moment.</p>

<p>Utterbourne stared at him, and, his lips trembling a little
with devious mirth, he muttered, in almost a tone of quizzical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
exaltation: “Will wonders never cease?” After that there
fell a pause, and then, under the stars, like the first welcome
note of a returning serenity after much storm, they heard
the Captain gently humming his favourite snatch of Macdowell.</p>

<span class="smaller">WEDDING BELLS IN THE OFFING</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="dropcap">Strange forces were at work in the world; but the sun
came up still and flashing out of the sea, and the birds
had business of their own to attend to.</p>

<p>Tsuda stirred stiffly and opened his eyes; but it took him
some seconds to regain his bearings. He got up slowly and
rather rheumatically. His asthma seemed pretty bad this
morning. He rubbed himself, and studied with rueful attention
some of the badges of his fray. One eye he could only
open a little way, and the flesh all about it was deeply discoloured.</p>

<p>Presently Sutherland came and led him to Utterbourne’s
cabin, where the Captain and Tsuda remained closeted a long
time. Then the others were called into conference.</p>

<p>“Come in, please,” the Captain called to them in his quaint
sing-song. “We were just discussing—h’m?” He sat drumming
on his desk with a pencil, and gazed at Tsuda in a
thoughtful, detached way. His face was serious and impassive,
but a wan smile flitted across it, too, in little vague
waves, and he began again mildly: “We seem to be making
a failure of it. We don’t seem quite to have grasped the
technique—h’m?” He looked with a faintly mocking appeal
from one face to another; but on Tsuda’s his gaze kept lingering,
and he always drew it off with a quizzical debating
wrench. “I pick up a man at sea,” the Captain went on,
“and the minute I look at him I think of my island. King
fell right into my hands, as though from heaven—as though
from heaven,” he murmured dreamily; “and what really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
extraordinary qualifications he seemed to have. It doesn’t
require much genius—mostly an unfailing, indescribable
sense of adventure—plenty of imagination—h’m?—the sort
that attains a momentum and can live on itself—you know?
And an appreciation of picturesque values.... Yes, King
seemed the man in a million. And we really needed him, too.
He couldn’t be thought of as a luxury. What if Tsuda had
suddenly got heart failure, or dropped dead of apoplexy,
without another soul on the island but the Ainu? As
a corporation we were always a little too close. That was
our weakness. But,” he continued, “no sooner is he nicely
established here than he falls victim to the thing itself! Isn’t
it funny? Isn’t it simply amazing where weakness will crop
out in the human animal?” There seemed almost a note of
whimsical, detached, and even philosophic triumph in his
voice. “With King it turned out to be opium, and with
Tsuda,” he smiled like Mona Lisa, “it’s turned out to be—King’s
wife!”</p>

<p>There was a sharp edge to his words, though he remained
otherwise without passion. An expression of weariness etched
itself about his mouth, and he flung out a little petulant
gesture, staring at Tsuda with a sleepy gleam of reproach.
Tsuda leaned forward anxiously, as Utterbourne turned to the
other men in the cabin. “Rutherford—Sargeant—any suggestions?
Sutherland? Do you think the island isn’t perhaps
worth the candle?”</p>

<p>But they knew him too well to avail themselves of the extended
invitation, and so merely smiled like a whole row
of Mona Lisas, for they glimpsed that the Captain had already
come to his decision, whatever it might prove. And it developed
that they were right, for, after more characteristic
word-play, and a quotation from Amiel about taking illusions
seriously, Utterbourne announced, his look holding at last a
devious and forgiving note: “Tsuda had thought a little of
journeying to Tōkyō and offering himself, because of some
obligation or other, to his Emperor, for whom it seems he
harbours a really touching regard; but I’ve managed to convince<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
him that he ought to stay right on here with these people
who look upon him as almost a kind of emperor himself—with
due respect of course, for Cha-cha-kamui, who has such
a fetching way of wearing his crown this year! Tsuda will
temporarily oversee the whole business. He’s such a dangerous
man that I tremble to supply him with another Kami.
They’re pretty scarce, I’m afraid—like lark puddings, or the
perfume of the magnifica.”</p>

<p>So Tsuda was escorted ashore and reinstated; and soon
the tiny waterfront swarmed with Ainu. In an hour the
chests of opium were coming aboard. All was hustle and
bustle, and Tsuda had been instructed, as soon as the last chest
was stowed, to declare a little Ainu holiday by way of celebrating
the completion of the year’s work. Utterbourne had
delivered a few fresh casks of saké, and these promised to
make the affair really memorable.</p>

<p class="tb">The Captain strolled up to the house of the White Kami,
his soul somehow afflicted with a mood of uneasiness. The
situation was certainly not all he could desire.</p>

<p>He entered and found King stretched out lifeless.</p>

<p>Stella met him at the door, and the look in her eyes—a
wonderful look of sorrow and release combined—told him,
even there on the threshold, that the end had come.</p>

<p>Soon after dawn King had called out to her very feebly;
and when she reached him she knew at once that it was the
end. After the long, long horror he died quite peacefully.
Just at the last his brain seemed to clear. A little light
crept into his eyes, making them for a moment faintly blue
and round again. He half stretched out his arms, and Stella,
bending down close to his lips, heard him murmur her
name. He sighed a few times and was gone. They closed
his eyes and folded a sheet smooth across his sunken breast
which rose and fell no longer.</p>

<p>Stella now was tearless and calm. Her look brought a
quick emotion to Jerome’s throat; and, as he entered the room,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
an elusive tenderness seemed to come also upon the enigmatic
Captain.</p>

<p>“My God,” they thought they heard him say again, very
softly.</p>

<p>There was something fugitively poetic and sublimating
about it—a devious spiritual touch, as though the Captain perhaps
saw, even more poignantly than Jerome, that she was a
woman at length. Stella fancied there a gleam of shy sympathy,
with a hitherto impregnable barrier for a fleeting instant
broken down.</p>

<p class="tb">They buried Mr. King, just at the hour of a radiant tropical
sunset, in a scented bower near the house; and they remained
a little while in silence gazing at the plot of vexed earth beneath
which lay all that remained of that being who had
played so curious a part in the affairs of the universe.</p>

<p>Meantime the Ainu, uncognizant of their irreparable loss,
had assembled in the house of the great chief, Cha-cha-kamui,
who was present in all his grandeur, wearing the robe of red
and white cloth, and on his gigantic head the crown of shavings
and gilt. Outside, children played about in a noisy unimaginative
way, and the women of the tribe sat on the ground
working their distaffs dully. Cha-cha-kamui’s Small Wife
passed among them, a little distant and haughty—for it was
known that in former days the White Kami had looked with
favour upon her.</p>

<p>Later on Tsuda would stage some sort of learned pagan ritual
celebrating the return of the White Kami to the Brotherhood
of the Blessed. But such processes require time—as
they do in the mystic Shinshū mountains—and for the present
it sufficed that there was plenty of saké.</p>

<p>When revelry was at its height, Tsuda, who had drunk
nothing and seemed very sad and cast down, slipped out of the
house of the chief and away to the edge of the sea.</p>

<p>The <i>Star of Troy</i> was hoisting her anchor. Every sound
was vividly audible in the hush of early evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<p>He sat down in a despondent heap on the dock and leaned
wearily up against the tilted derrick. In a little while there
would be only a drifting plume of smoke along the horizon.</p>

<p class="tb">Elsa, on deck, under the festive bit of awning aft, was gazing
through her glasses.</p>

<p>“The Ainu,” she observed, letting her eyes droop very
much, “must still be carousing. There’s no one to be seen
on the whole island but that Japanese. I hear you attacked
him like a lot of Indians last night,” she smiled.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jerome replied, “I’m afraid I was a little more noisy
than the situation really called for.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” she assured him, her brown eyes full of
moist yet undemonstrative appreciation, “it must have been
really quite splendid. I’m sorry I had to miss it.”</p>

<p>“How did you spend the evening?”</p>

<p>“After you went ashore? Oh, I read a few chapters in my
stupid book, and tried to walk myself sleepy—well, what kind
of an evening would you expect me to put in, with no thrills
but those I could stir up myself? And all the while you were
having wild and impossible adventures—you and Stella and
the Japanese and Stella’s prince.... It really seems unfair,
doesn’t it? I shall never forgive the Captain for keeping me
cooped up out here.” And then she added with feeling, yet
very evenly: “How I <em>hate</em> being a woman!”</p>

<p>Stella watched them from a little distance. She seemed
eagerly observing every detail of their conduct together, with
eyes which contained only a look of quiet inevitability.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she murmured to herself, “it would be like
that. It would have to be.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” asked Elsa, smiling up at him in her
grave, unassailable way, “you’ll be having such adventures in
Tripoli?”</p>

<p>He shrugged, and Stella heard him laugh.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Stella thought. She didn’t know what they
were talking about, but was merely carrying on the thread of
her own speculations. “It would have to turn out some such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
way as this—to be quite perfect and complete. Yes, it would
have to.” And in a moment she thought, with a little more
agitation: “How familiar they are—like old, old friends.
He finds in her all he’s missed in me. How complete! How
perfect—that I should come out of it with nothing but a
moral....”</p>

<p>Her heart was flooded with a rush of passionate regret.</p>

<p>They were taking turns peering through Elsa’s binoculars.</p>

<p>“Looks peaceful, doesn’t it, with all the palms and the sunset?”</p>

<p>“Yes—may I have a look?”</p>

<p>“Your Japanese seems rather dejected. I’m afraid you
<em>were</em> a bit rough.”</p>

<p>“What would you have done under the circumstances?”</p>

<p>“Just what you did, I’m sure. Let’s have another peep before
we are out of range.”</p>

<p>Slowly the <i>Star of Troy</i> picked her path among the reefs
and wore to sea. But for a long time the figure of Tsuda,
huddled on the ruined dock in the sunset, was still visible.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>It was about eight o’clock in the evening, and Flora Utterbourne
sat by a lamp in her little apartment. She was wearing
the same gown she wore the day she met Mr. Curry on the
way to Crawl Hill. A book lay in her lap. She was expecting
some people who were to drop in and look the apartment
over with an eye to subletting from her. She read a little
and cut a few pages with her tiny Swiss paper knife. A small
clock was ticking somewhere in shadow. It was very quiet:
no sounds but the ticking of the clock and the rustle of pages.
After a bit she closed the book upon a long first finger and
let her head drop back against the Egyptian shawl which so
beautifully disguised and enriched a very plain little second
hand arm chair. She closed her eyes and sat musing.</p>

<p>Presently there was a ring at the door. Ah, she thought,
the people to look at the apartment. And she glanced lovingly
about as she went to admit them to her sanctum. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
rooms were somehow so entirely <em>hers</em>. One would suppose
she had lived here always. Everything delighted and refreshed
the eye. Here one encountered the most harmonious
sort of colour combination. The little drawing room illustrated
the fine compatibility of cream white, Burgundy
rose, quiet apple green and plum and there were delicate
touches here and there of red and indigo, and even warm,
bright orange. Over the little white wood mantle was an
antique-looking reproduction of Burne-Jones’ familiar panel
of angels on a winding stair; in a dimmer spot was a madonna
of Raphael’s. Flora took it all in as she crossed,
with just a tremor of wistful hesitation.</p>

<p>But lo! no sooner had she opened the door than she uttered
an incredulous cry. Then she held out her hand, and a moment
later a man had her right in his arms—a big man in a
Palm Beach suit, wearing gay rings and a beautiful new shiny
toupee. Curry had paused for only one thing after landing.
A new toupee. He couldn’t call the way he was—it might
have proved positively fatal!</p>

<p>Well, as one may imagine, the first quarter of an hour or
so was simply indescribable. No, it is useless even to attempt
it. Both talked at once nearly the whole of the time, and
laughed. After that things began to quiet down a little,
though there were still intermittent outbursts. How could
they help themselves?</p>

<p>It developed that the impulsive impresario, who was behaving
just exactly like a kid, hadn’t had a mouthful of dinner.
There was talk of slipping out together for something;
but then Flora remembered she had promised to be at home
all evening on account of the people who were coming to look
at the apartment. And Curry wouldn’t go out alone. He said
he’d starve first. So Flora said: “Let’s go and <em>see</em> what there
is in the ‘ice box,’ though I’m dreadfully <em>afraid</em> there isn’t
enough to satisfy such a big hungry <em>man</em>!”</p>

<p>But behold! there was! Oh, yes—there was a really sumptuous
dinner in the ice box! Flora evolved a fine crisp
salad, and produced a little platter of cold chicken. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
made a pot of coffee, while, under her cordial and excited
directions, the impresario spread a cloth on their gate-legged
table and brought out the requisite silver and china. In ever
so short a time they were seated with their table between them.
And Flora said that of <em>course</em> she couldn’t really eat a <em>thing</em>,
but that she would just <em>nibble</em> a little to keep him “company.”</p>

<p>Her face took on a look of exaggerated, grave, and high
concern as he told her more about the wreck of the <i>Skipping
Goone</i> than it had been possible to squeeze into a cable. His
eyes brimmed for a moment with the unhappy memory.
But then her face lighted, for he was reminding her that,
after all, here he was, safe and sound—“alive to tell the tale,
though Good Lord! when the bolt struck us I never expected
to be!”</p>

<p>Her voice was rich with happiness. “And <em>Africa</em>,” she
laughed, “—I was ‘reading up’ on it so <em>diligently</em>. I thought
I’d even try to go <em>down</em> there, since my agent says he hears
there are delightful ‘apartments’ in <em>Johannesburg</em>!”</p>

<p>But Mr. Curry shook his head slowly, and his eyes looked
suspiciously moist again. He was thinking of his songbirds.
When he spoke there was a tone of deep sadness in his voice.
“We’ve come to the end of our world tour that was going to
mark such an epoch in the history of opera—” He sighed a
little.</p>

<p>“But,” she told him warmly, “I think it has, <em>anyhow</em>!”</p>

<p>“Everything went,” he mused, “—scenery, properties—even
my glorious prima donna—”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Flora in alarm. “Miss <em>Valentine</em>? She—she
wasn’t <em>drowned</em>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he laughed. “Merely gobbled up by one of the
big bugs, that’s all.”</p>

<p>She showed him, nevertheless, a face full of sympathetic
despair. “It’s the most <em>outrageous</em> thing I ever <em>heard</em> of!”</p>

<p>But it all seemed to matter so little to him now. He seized
her hands and gave her a look of such delightful impetuosity
that she couldn’t help looking down at her plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you see?” he cried in a loud gay voice. “It’s
brought us to the way out!”</p>

<p>“<em>Has</em> it?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>“There’s a chance, if we hold hands tight and jump, of
getting off the merry-go-round at last!”</p>

<p>“Oh—<em>tell</em> me about it!” she begged, her face brimming
with eagerness.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “since I’m ruined, what’s to be done but
make the best of things? There may be brighter days
ahead, but right this minute things might be worse than
they are. The fact is, I know of a job—it’s as leader of the
orchestra in a theatre here in San Francisco. I—I believe
it’s a movie theatre, but what of that? It wouldn’t last forever,
and I’d keep my eyes open all the time for a chance to
put over my great dream. In the meantime, though humble,
the job would pay—well, enough for two to live on, I guess,
if we didn’t sail too high. And at least it would be all in
one place—the job, I mean—which is an advantage that
couldn’t be claimed by the world tour, you see! Lord, it’s
too beautiful to think of!”</p>

<p>And she was quite as excited and pleased as he. “Why,
I’m <em>sure</em> we could manage, and it would <em>really</em> be the finest
kind of <em>adventure</em> to have to skrimp and ‘figure,’ and I’ve a
small ‘income,’ you know, from all those <em>apartments</em> in the
East, so that if the ‘wolf’ ever actually <em>threatened</em> to break
in, why we could sell some of the <em>things</em>, though of course I
<em>know</em>,” she embroidered, “your job at the ‘movies’ couldn’t
last <em>forever</em>, since new opportunities are <em>sure</em> to open up—we’ll
make them!” For suddenly she remembered, and not
without a quick little heartache, how he had poured out to
her his big, ardent dreams that day at the Hoadley auction.
“I’ll ‘back you up’ with all my <em>might</em>,” she said in her gracious,
heartening way. “We’ll manage by ‘hook or crook’ to
keep <em>advancing</em>, and in the meantime, we can stay right on
<em>here</em> in this little <em>place</em>, which is so comfortable, though of
course <em>small</em>, and to which I think I’ve grown more ‘attached’
than to any of the <em>others</em>—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span></p>

<p>There was an interrupting ring. Her face fell.</p>

<p>“Oh—I’d <em>forgotten</em>! The people who are thinking of sub-<em>letting</em>....”
She rose, a little upset.</p>

<p>But Curry kept his head—and afterward bragged of it, too.
“Don’t even let ’em cross the doorstep!” he commanded, very
firmly. “Tell ’em you’re out. Tell ’em you’ve changed your
mind. Tell ’em anything at all, but don’t let them in!”</p>

<p>And when the intruders were safely disposed of, the big,
joyous impresario, smiling as he certainly never smiled before
in his whole life, made Flora tie one of her aprons around
his waist; and he insisted on washing the dishes, while she
dried them.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Three weeks later the <i>Star of Troy</i> slipped in. She never
arrived with any fanfare—that was not her way.</p>

<p>It was agreed that Stella should go home alone, and, with
such fortitude as she could summon, convey to her family
the tragic aspect of this return. She preferred it that way.
A cable had gone out to them from India; but nothing had
been said about King, and she faced a task which brought its
shudder. Better, almost better, she thought at times, to
have them carry home her dead body, than to come back
with things as they stood. But in her stronger moments she
grimly welcomed the ordeal.</p>

<p>First there was just a moment of overwhelming happiness,
with her father’s arms about her, and Maud stretching out
her dear formless lips for a kiss, and Ted with his near-sighted
eyes full of welcome behind their bright-looking glasses, and
the incorrigible voice of Aunt Alice rushing pell-mell down
the stairs. Stella felt as though she could not endure the
almost terrible happiness, while it lasted. And then—</p>

<p>Well, she slumped down into a chair and told them about
her husband. She spoke of him tensely, yet her voice was
not clouded with blame. She cried a little. And then she
was in her father’s arms again, and all he could say was:
“Stella—Stella....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<p>After that life settled down in the house. Stella gradually
took up her old duties, quietly and gratefully; yet she could
not quite believe, sometimes, that the long, long horror was
forever still. Her nights at first were troubled, even terrible;
and by day, she never smiled.</p>

<p>Jerome fell easily into the way of dropping in to spend
an evening. He held them all breathless with his multiple
adventures, though the darker phases were not touched upon.</p>

<p>At first he and Stella were but little alone together. He
had become, it would seem, just a good comfortable friend
of the family, and his tongue was always gayest when they
were all assembled in the cosy back parlour. She felt his
aloofness, as she had felt it first on that far-off night in the
temple, though it was warmer now, and somehow less oppressively
personal. Yet this way, to Stella, it seemed an even
harder thing to face. His unfailing cheerfulness and that
most amazing worldly nonchalance seemed thrusting their
destinies ever farther and farther apart. Her tragedy seemed
indeed complete. Had he really fallen in love with Elsa?
she asked herself. And the answer was always the same, patiently,
inevitably: “It would be like that. It would have
to be.”</p>

<p>One evening, however, a curious change came. Jerome and
Stella were sitting out together on the front steps. He had
been gay as usual an hour ago in the back parlour; but now,
here in the thoughtful dark, seemed sunk in a deep realm
of reverie. As a matter of fact, Jerome was busy with far-flung
conjecture. There was a good deal to plan—his whole
life, for that matter, which, at his age, represented a contract
of no mean proportions. The Mediterranean project
was definitely on, and in two weeks Jerome would depart for
Tripoli—and the Lord knew what! It was immensely exciting.
It seemed the dawn of a real career for him.</p>

<p>He had been perhaps a little more worldly than usual tonight;
but now his mood seemed to warm and soften.
“Stella,” he began, then hesitated, and ended by reaching
out and taking her hand. He held it a long time in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span></p>

<p>At last he began to speak, his voice a little husky with
new emotion. Stella felt her heart respond in a dumb, incredulous
way. But he had said only a few words when an
unexpected interruption occurred.</p>

<p>A smart little car darted up and stopped, and out of it
came Elsa with a boyish bound, which had about it, however,
a certain trim and self-sufficient grace. Stella drew her hand
gently out of Jerome’s warm clasp, and they rose to welcome
the newcomer.</p>

<p>There was a very faint and echoy trace of the old romantic
flutter in Stella’s voice as she suggested they go into the
parlour. But Elsa, in her cool, blunt, even subtly tactless
way, would not hear of it. “I like it much better outside,
and anyway I can only stop a minute. I’m picking up dad
at the club.”</p>

<p>She gazed at Jerome, just an instant, somewhat queerly;
and then she gazed at them both without any expression at
all. Her heart was not without its emotion—but emotion
so jealously guarded that no one on earth could possibly
hope to obtain the slightest clue to it.</p>

<p>She sat down with them on the steps and talked of trivial
things. Jerome was unexpectedly silent. Finally she turned
to him, drawling:</p>

<p>“You’re getting to be an awful stranger over our way. I
suppose the journey scares you out.”</p>

<p>And before he could make any reply at all, she had turned
calmly back to Stella with unrelated matters, her tone just a
shade too eager, perhaps, to be <em>quite</em> worthy of the established
Utterbourne imperturbability.</p>

<p>When she was gone, Stella mused: “Elsa never changes.
She’s always just the same.” And then, on an undercurrent
of dark brooding: “It must be wonderful to be able to go
through life that way,” the woman tensely murmured.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” replied Jerome, not quite at his ease still,
but behaving more normally now the other girl had departed.</p>

<p>Stella almost surrendered, right on the spot, to a throbbing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
impulse to ask him: “What is Elsa to you, and what are you
to her?” But she merely sat silent; and in a way perhaps
more convincing than any words, the unformed query was
answered, after a moment or two, by Jerome’s gently seeking
her hand again.</p>

<p>“Jerome....” she faltered, but her look was growing
almost radiant.</p>

<p>“Stella, dear....” His voice was husky once more.
“I love you.”</p>

<p>And then everything seemed altered, and she said, because
she simply couldn’t help it: “Jerome—I thought it was—I
thought you loved Elsa....”</p>

<p>He smiled, reminiscent and a little grave. “If things had
turned out differently with you, there might have come a
time.... You see we met just when I felt—well, when I felt,
or thought I did, about everything a good deal the way she
did. I don’t know....” But after a tiny silence he ended,
very simply: “As it is, I only want you, Stella.”</p>

<p>And then—oh, well, it was a wonderful night. Love
seemed to rush back and overwhelm them. It was far more
thrilling than anything in the old days, yet it was all very
quiet and simple.</p>

<p>Bracing himself just a little, and in secret glad of the dark,
Jerome told her the rest about Lili, while she turned wide eyes
upon him and listened. He kept nothing back, because—well,
because it <em>was</em> such a wonderful night; and besides,
he had a feeling that the foundations of their whole future
happiness were, in a sense, being laid now, and there must be
no false masonry. At first it seemed so strange to her that
she couldn’t speak.</p>

<p>He wondered, a little darkly, what was passing in her mind.
There were misgivings; but at length she gave his hand a
pressure, and she said:</p>

<p>“I see, Jerome. I’m glad you told me.”</p>

<p>Naturally, after that, he breathed more easily. And then
he went on talking about all the things that had gone to make
up the fabric of his life since it was sundered from hers. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
poured out to her the love that had been in his heart for the
little son they had had to leave at sea, and felt her sympathy,
warm and intimate. A glow seemed to envelop them both.</p>

<p>Here they were, on the steps, holding hands—just as in the
old days, only of course now it was all more wonderful.
Strange, they thought—so strange: somehow as though the
tiny seed of return had been present even in that dark and
groping lovers’ quarrel up Market street....</p>

<p>She snuggled against him softly. Thoughts of the new life
just setting in flooded her heart with solemn happiness. She
watched the dim trees stirring in the night wind. Stella
was quite as far from Irmengarde as before. Alas, she would
never be like Irmengarde, after all. But she didn’t care.
And when it came to life and the serious facts of living—good
heavens! she had had experiences that would make
Irmengarde faint right away and never come to again.</p>

<p>She leaned against Jerome’s shoulder in a happy, tired
way. Life had snatched them up and set them down again.
Yes, life had played pranks with them both, as life will sometimes—incredibly
or not, it makes no difference; tragically
or absurdly, there remains nothing to be said. And Jerome
grasped his happiness, too.</p>

<p>“Somehow,” she said, her voice all warmth and tenderness,
with a touch of humour also, at last, “I wish you weren’t
going away, but were going to get back your old job at Oaks-Ferguson’s!”
And for the first time, almost, since that night
the little dinner wasn’t eaten—Stella smiled. “But I know,”
she went on humorously, “you’d never be happy <em>there</em> again,
and—well, as soon as you can come back to marry me, I’ll
be ready to go away with you.”</p>

<p>“Back to Tripoli?” he murmured, his eyes full of love,
but touched also with ambitious, worldly dreams.</p>

<p>“Wherever the work takes you,” she said.</p>

<p>Then there came a subtle twinkle in his eye, and, though
with great tenderness, he couldn’t resist reminding her: “You
used to talk so much about visiting Paris. Some day—well,
some day, you know, it might be even that—you never can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
tell, Stella. Wouldn’t it be funny,” he laughed, “to think
of us living in Paris!”</p>

<p>They kissed, like children, without embracing.</p>

<p>And just as he went away, he pressed a ring into her hand.
“I know you don’t want to wear it now,” he said, “but just
keep it where you can look at it sometimes. It will help
you to remember. And later on,” he added, “we’ll trade it
in at Ascher’s for a bigger stone. But the man told me that
it’s a good little diamond, at that, for its size.”</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
